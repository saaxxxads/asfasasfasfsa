In 1922 the book was reprinted with an ''Ausfuhrliches Sachregister&quot; prepared by Gerda Walther. Reprinted again in 1928, the book contained a ^Sachregis-ter&quot; prepared by Ludwig Landgrebe replacing that of Gerda Walther. A new edition of the book was published in 1950 by Martinus Nyhoff, The Hague. Edited by Walter Biemel, the title page states that the edition is a &quot;Neu, auf Grund der handschriftli-chen Zusatze des Verfassers erweiterte AuHage.&quot; This edition, published as Volume III of Edmund Husserl, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Gesammelte Werke (Hus</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">・</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> serliana)</span><span class="font17"> included additions, insertions and marginal notes of Husserl which were either run into the text itself or printed in a section of &quot;Textkritische Anmerkungen&quot; (pp. 463Y83). Much of this supplementary material was taken from three copies </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of Ideen</span><span class="font17"> which Husserl annotated between 1913 and 1929. Biemel also included as appendices manuscripts ofHusserl in which he either developed further certain ideas in the text or else tried to rewrite existing sections of the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In 1976 BiemePs edition was replaced by one edited by Dr. Karl Schuhmann </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(Husserliana</span><span class="font17"> III, 1 and III, 2), also published by Martinus NijhofT. This new edition establishes a corrected text of the three editions printed during HusserPs lifetime and contains, in a second volume, revised and corrected texts of the supplementary material found in BiemePs edition along with material not found in that edition. In addition to reproducing HusserPs annotations in still</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">another copy of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Ideen</span><span class="font17"> (the copies are identified as Copies A, B, C, D),<sup>1 </sup>this edition prints, among others, all of the manuscripts which Husserl had prepared for W. R. Boyce Gibson but which the latter did not use in his translation.<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Every effort has been made to conform the present translation to the text as published by Dr. Schuhmann. Included in footnotes is a representative selection ofHusserFs annotations in his four copies of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Ideen</span><span class="font17"> along with a number ofvery short appendices. The source of the note is identified according to Dr. Schuhmann's edition (e.g., ''Addition in Copy A”)</span><span class="font11">，</span><span class="font17">while HusserFs own footnotes in the printed editions during his lifetime are identified by the locution, “AUTHOR'S FOOTNOTE/<sup>5</sup> Numbers of the appendices refer to Dr. Schuhmann's arrangement of them. Unless otherwise stated, the supplementary material is to be applied after the word to which the footnote is affixed. All internal page references, including those of the indices, are to the pages of the first printed edition and which appear in the margins of the pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Although all of the supplementary materials published by Dr. Schuhmann is valuable to anyone seeking a thorough scholarly and philosophical understanding of HusserFs great work (Dr. Schuhmann published 38 pages ofHusserFs annotations, and 132 pages of appendices), chiefly for reasons of economy I have translated only a selection of this material. As a consequence, the make up of this volume differs from that of Dr. Schuhmann. Taken as a whole, however, the supplementary materials included in the present translation provide what, in myjudgment, is a good picture of a significant commentary by Husserl on his own text over a period of about sixteen years and which, I believe, will satisfy the immediate needs of the English-speaking reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A basic concern in making this translation has been to preserve HusserFs distinctions in English and to render his ideas by expressions which conform to the things themselves which he sought to describe. Of great help in this connection was the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Guidefor Translating Husserl</span><span class="font17"> by Dorion Cairns<sup>3</sup>. The translation also benefited from a comparison with the following published translations: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Idles directrices pour unephenomenologie,</span><span class="font17"> traduitde Fallemand par Paul Ricoeur (Paris: Gallimard, 1950); </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Ideas relativas a una fenomenologia pur ay una filosofia fenomenol6gica\</span><span class="font17"> con las adiciones, notas marginales y correcciones postumas, traducido porjose Gaos (Mexico-Buenos Aires: Fondo de Cultura Economica, 1962)</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Ideas: General Introduction</span><span class="font7"> 勿 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Pure Phenomenology,</span><span class="font17"> translated by W. R. Boyce Gibson (London: George Allen &amp;&nbsp;Unwin Ltd., 1931).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A translation is always only that — a translation. While it is possible to make HusserFs philospphy accessible and, hopefully, equally plausible in English, it is also to be hoped that final judgment of the work will be made of the expression of this philosophy in the original, and that the failings of the translator will not be laid to the author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I dedicate this translation to the memory of my Mother, who thoughtfully gave me my copy of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Ideen</span><span class="font17"> as a graduation present from college; and to the memory of Dorion Cairns, who patiently helped me learn to read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">W. R. Boyce Gibson's translation </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of Ideen</span><span class="font17"> was of great help to me in preparing my translation, and I have tried to preserve the high standard he set for the translation of Husserl.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">IDEAS PERTAINING TO A PURE PHENOMENOLOGY AND TO A PHENOMENOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;1&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">Pure phenomenology, the way to which we seek here, the unique position of which relative to all other sciences we shall characterize and show to be the science fundamental to philosophy, is an essentially new science which, in consequence of its most radical essential peculiarity, is remote from natural thinking and therefore only in our days presses toward development. It is called a science of &quot;phenomena&quot;. Other sciences, long known, also concern phenomena. Thus we hear that psychology is designated as a science of psychical <sup>&lt;^</sup>appearances^^ or phenomena and that natural science is designated as a science of physical &quot;appearances&quot; or phenomena; likewise on occasion historical phenomena are spoken of in the science ofhistory, cultural phenomena in the science of culture; and something similar is true of all other sciences of realities. No matter how varied may be the sense of the word &quot;phenomena&quot; in such locutions, and no matter what further significations it may have, it is certain that phenomenology also relates to all these &quot;phenomena&quot; and does so with respect to all significations of the word ^phenomenon.<sup>5,</sup> But phenomenology relates to them in a wholly different attitude whereby any sense of the word &quot;phenomenon&quot; which we find in the long-known sciences becomes modified in a definite way. To understand these modifications or, to speak more precisely, to bring about the phenomenological attitude and, by reflecting, to elevate its specific peculiarity and that of the natural attitudes into the scientific consciousness — this is the first and by no means easy task whose demands we must perfectly satisfy if we are to achieve the realm of phenomenology and scientifically assure ourselves of the essence proper to phenomenology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">During the last decade much has been said in German philosophy </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">2</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">and psychology about phenomenology. In supposed agreement with</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen^</span><span class="font17"> phenomenology has been conceived as a substratum of empirical psychology, as a sphere comprising &quot;imma</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> nental” descriptions of psychical mental processes, a sphere comprising descriptions that — so the immanence in question is understood —are strictly confined within the bounds of internal </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">experience.</span><span class="font17"> It would seem that my protest against this conception<sup>2</sup> has been oflittle avail; and the added explanations, which sharply pinpointed at least some chief points of difference, either have not been understood or have been heedlessly pushed aside. Thus the replies directed against my criticism of psychological method are also quite negative because they miss the straightforward </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sense</span><span class="font17"> of my presentation. My criticism of psychological method did not at all deny the value of modern psychology, did not at all disparage the experimental work done by eminent men. Rather it laid bare certain, in the literal sense, radical defects of method upon the removal of which, in my opinion, must depend an elevation of psychology to a higher scientific level and an extraordinary amplification of its field of work. Later an occasion will be found to say a few words about the unnecessary defences of psychology against my supposed <sup>&lt;^</sup>attacks.^^<sup>3</sup> I touch on this dispute here so that, in view of the prevailing misinterpretations, ever so rich in consequences, I can sharply emphasize from the start </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">that pure phenomenology<sub>}</sub></span><span class="font17"> access to which we shall prepare in the following essay —the same phenomenology that made a first break-through in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen,</span><span class="font17"> and the sense of which has opened itself up to me more deeply and richly in the continuing work of the last decade </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^ is notp^chology</span><span class="font17"> and that neither accidental delimitations ofits field nor its terminologies, but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">most radical essential</span><span class="font17"> grounds, prevent its inclusion in psychology. No matter how great the significance which phenomenology must claim to have for the method ofpsychology, no</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">matter how essential the &quot;fbundations&quot; which it furnishes for it, pure phenomenology (if only because it is a science of ideas) is no more psychology than geometry is natural science. Indeed, the difference proves to be an even more radical one than that in the case com- &lt;3&gt; pared. The fact that pure phenomenology is not psychology is in no respect altered by the fact that phenomenology has to do with<sup>4 </sup>&quot;consciousness J with all sorts of mental processes, acts and act-correlates. What with the prevailing habits of thinking, to achieve an insight into that indeed requires no little effort. That we set aside all hitherto prevailing habits of thinking, that we recognize and tear down the intellectual barrier with which they confine the horizon of our thinking and now, with full freedom of thought, seize upon the genuine philosophical problems to be set completely anew made accessible to us only by the horizon open on all sides: these are hard demands. But nothing less is required. Indeed, what makes so extraordinarily hard the acquisition of the proper essence of phenomenology, the understanding of the peculiar sense of its problems, and ofits relationship to all other sciences (in particular to psychology), is that, for all this, a new </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">style &quot;attitude</span><span class="font17"> is needed which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">entirely altered </span><span class="font17">in contrast to the natural attitude in experiencing and the natural attitude in thinking. To move freely in it without relapsing into the old attitudes, to learn to see, distinguish, and describe what lies within view, require, moreover, peculiar and laborious studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It will be the pre-eminent task of this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">First</span><span class="font17"> Book to seek ways by which the excessive difficulties of penetrating into this new world can be overcome, so to speak, piece by piece. We shall start from the natural standpoint, from the world as it confronts us, from<sup>5</sup> consciousness as it offers itselfin psychological experience; and we shall lay bare the presuppositions essential to psychological experience. We shall then develop a method of &quot;'phenomenological reductions&quot; &lt;of psychological experience), with respect to which we cannot only do away with barriers to cognition that belong to the essence of every natural style of research but which, at the same time, also divert the one-sided direction of regard proper to every natural style of research until we shall have acquired, finally, the free vista of &quot;transcendentally&quot; purified phenomena and, therewith, the field of phenomenology in our peculiar sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us draw the preliminarily indicative lines yet a little more definitely; and let us start from psychology as demanded not only by the prejudices of the times but also by the internal communities of the matter in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Psychology</span><span class="font17"> is an experiential science. Two things are implied in the usual sense of the word &quot;experience:&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">I . It is a science of/</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">s, of matters of fact in David Hume's sense.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">2 . It is a science of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">realities.</span><span class="font17"> The &quot;phenomena&quot; that it, as psych-&lt;4&gt; ological &quot;phenomenology,&quot; deals with are real occurrences which, as such occurrences, if they have actual existence, find their place with the real subjects to whom they belong in the one spatiotemporal world as the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">omnitudo realitatis.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">In contradistinction to that, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure or transcendental phenomenology will </span><span class="font17">become established, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not as a science of matters of fact, but as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> science of essences</span><span class="font17"> (as an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">''eidetic&quot;</span><span class="font17"> science); it will become established as a science which exclusively seeks to ascertain &quot;cognitions of essences” and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">no &quot;matters offact^ whatever.</span><span class="font17"> The relevant reduction which leads over from the psychological phenomena to the pure &quot;essence&quot; or, in the case ofjudgmental thinking, from matter-of-fact (''empirical'') universality to &quot;eidetic&quot; universality, is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic reduction.^</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Secondly, the phenomena of transcendental phenomenology will become characterized as irreal [irreal].</span><span class="font17"> Other reductions, the specifically transcendental ones, &quot;purify” psychological phenomena from what confers on them reality and, with that, their place in the real-world.'&quot;* Our phenomenology is to be an eidetic doctrine, not of phenomena that are real, but of phenomena that are transcendentally reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What all this signifies will become distinct in greater detail only in what follows. In a precursory manner, it designates a schematic framework of the introductory series of investigations. I hold it necessary to add only one remark here. It will strike the reader that in the aforementioned two points, instead of the generally customary single separation of sciences into sciences of realities and sciences of idealities (or into empirical sciences and a priori sciences), two separations of sciences appear to be used which correspond to the two contrasting pairs: matter of fact and essence, real and non-real. In place of the usual contrast between real and ideal, the distinguishing</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marginal note in Copy D opposite the latter part of this sentence:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> In advance, separation of the reduction into eidetic and specificallv phenomenological.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* Marginal note in Copy D:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> The manner of expression is dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">of these two contrasts will find a detailed justification in the later course of our investigations (and particularly in the Second Book). It will become apparent that the ordinary concept of reality needs a fundamental limitation according to which a difference between real being and individual being (temporal being simpliciter) must be established. The transition to pure essence yields, on the one side, eidetic cognition of the real; on the other side, with respect to the remaining sphere, it yields eidetic cognition of the irreal. Moreover, it will become apparent that all transcendentally purified &quot;mental processes&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[&quot;Erlebnisse&quot;]</span><span class="font17"> are irrealities posited outside any incorporation into the &quot;actual world.&quot; Just these irrealities are explored by phenomenology, not, however, as single particulars, but in &quot;es</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> sence.&quot; To what extent, however, transcendental phenomena as &lt;5&gt; single </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">facts</span><span class="font17"> are accessible to an investigation and what relationship such an investigation of matters of fact may have to the idea of metaphysics, can only be considered in the concluding series of investigations.<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">First</span><span class="font17"> Book, however, we shall not only treat the general doctrine of phenomenological reductions, which make transcendentally purified consciousness and its eidetic correlates visible and accessible to us; we shall also attempt to acquire definite ideas of the most general structure of this pure consciousness and, mediated by them, of the most general groups of problems, lines of investigations, and methods which belong to the new science.<sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Second</span><span class="font17"> Book we shall then treat in detail some particularly significant groups of problems, the systematic formulation and characteristic solution of which are the precondition for being able to make actually clear the difficult relationships of phenomenology, on the one hand, to the physical sciences ofNature, to psychology and to the cultural sciences; on the other hand, however, to all the a priori sciences. The projected phenomenological sketches on this occasion offer at the same time welcome means of considerably deepening the understanding of phenomenology gained in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">First</span><span class="font17"> Book and of acquiring an incomparably richer recognition of its vast areas of problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">^Marginal note</span><span class="font7"> /。</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">this sentence in Copy C:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Such sentences have been overlooked again and again. </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Marginal note in Copy D to the last two sentences of this paragraph:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> N.B.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Third</span><span class="font17"> and concluding Book is devoted to the idea of philosophy.<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The insight will be awakened that genuine philosophy, the idea of which is the actualizing of absolute cognition, is rooted in pure phenomenology; and rooted in it in a sense so important that the systematically strict grounding and working out of this first of all genuine philosophies is the incessant precondition for every metaphysics and other philosophy &quot;that will be able to make its appearance as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">science</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">：</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Because phenomenology will become established here as a science of essence — as an &quot;a priori&quot; or, as we also say, an eidetic science — it is useful to let all efforts that are to be devoted to phenomenology itselfbe preceded by a series of basic expositions concerning essences and eidetic science and, in opposition to naturalism, a defense of the original independent legitimacy of eidetic cognition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We close these introductory words with a brief consideration of </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">6</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">terminology. As already was the case in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen,</span><span class="font17"> I avoid as much as possible the expressions &quot;</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">priori&quot;'</span><span class="font17"> and &quot;</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">posteriori&quot; </span><span class="font17">because of the confusing obscurities and many significations clinging to them in general use, and also because of the notorious philosophical doctrines that, as an evil heritage from the past, are combined with them. They are to be used only in contexts that confer upon them unambiguousness and only as equivalents ofother terms which arejoined to them and on which we have conferred clear and univocal significations, particularly where it is a matter of allowing for historical parallels.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Generally, the following must be noted. Because it will not do to choose technical expressions that fall entirely outside the frame of historically given philosophical language and, above all, because fundamental philosophical concepts are not to be defined by means of firm concepts identifiable at all times on the basis of immediately accessible intuitions; because, rather, in general long investigations must precede their definitive clarifications and determinations: combined ways of speaking are therefore frequently indispensable which arrange together a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">plurality</span><span class="font17"> of expressions of common discourse which are in use in approximately the same sense and which give terminological pre-eminence to single expressions of this sort. One cannot define in philosophy as in mathematics; any imitation of mathematical procedure in this respect is not only unfruitful but wrong, and has most injurious consequences. For the rest, each of the above terminological expressions is to receive its fixed sense by means of a determinate, intrinsically evident validation of that sense in the deliberations to be carried out. Meanwhile, circumstantial critical comparisons with the philosophical tradition in this respect, as in all others, must be renounced if only because of the length of this work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§1 . Natural Cognition and Experience.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Natural cognition begins with experience and remains </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">within </span><span class="font17">experience. In the theoretical attitude which we call the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^natural&quot; (theoretical attitude^</span><span class="font17"> the collective horizon of possible investigations is therefore designated with </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> word: It is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">world.</span><span class="font17"> Accordingly, the sciences of this original<sup>2</sup> attitude are, in their entirety, sciences of the world; and, as long as it is the exclusively dominant &lt;theoretical attitude^ the concepts &quot;true being,&quot; &quot;actual being,&quot; that is, real being and — since everything real joins together to make up the unity of the world — &quot;being in the world&quot; coincide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To each science there corresponds an object-province as the domain ofits investigations; and to all its cognitions, i.e., here to all its correct statements, there correspond, as primal sources of the grounding which validates their legitimacy, certain intuitions in which objects belonging to the province become themselves-given as existing and, at least some of them, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">given originarily.</span><span class="font17"> The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">presentive </span><span class="font17">intuition </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[gebende</span><span class="font17"> Anschauung] belonging to the first, the &quot;natural&quot; sphere of cognition and to all sciences of that sphere, is natural experience; and the &lt;natural&gt; experience that is presentive of something </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originarily</span><span class="font17"> is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">perception^</span><span class="font17"> the word being understood in the ordi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">8</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">nary sense.<sup>3</sup> To have something real given originarily and “at</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> tentively to perceive'^ and <sup>t&lt;</sup>experience^^ it in an intuiting simpliciter are one and the same. We have originary experience of concrete physical things in ''external perception,&quot; but no longer in memory or in fb rwa rd - rega rd ing expectation; we have originary experience of ourself and<sup>5</sup> of our states of consciousness in so-called internal or selR perception; not, however, of others and oP their mental processes in &quot;empathy.&quot; As belonging to them, we &quot;view the mental processes of others&quot; on the basis of the perception of their outward manifestation in the organism. This empathic viewing is, more particularly, an intuiting, a presentive act, although no longer an act that is pre-sentive of something originarily. The other and his psychical life are, to be sure, given in consciousness as ''themselves there&quot; and in union with his organism; but they are not, like the latter, given in consciousness as originary.<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The world is the sum-total of objects of possible experience and experiential cognition, of objects that, on the basis of actual experiences, are cognizable in correct theoretical thinking. This is not the place to discuss how the methods of experiential science look when seen more closely, how that method grounds its right to go beyond the narrow bounds of direct experiential givenness. Sciences of the world, thus sciences in the natural attitude, the sciences of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">material</span><span class="font17"> nature, but also those of animate beings with their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">psychophysical nature,</span><span class="font17"> consequently also physiology, psychology, and so forth, are all so-called </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">natural sciences</span><span class="font17"> in the narrower and broader sense. Likewise all the so-called </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Geisteswissenschaften</span><span class="font17"> belong here: the science of history, the sciences ofculture, sociological disciplines of every sort. Concerning these we can, for the present, leave it an open question whether they should be treated as like the natural sciences or contrasted with them, whether they should be regarded as themselves natural sciences or as sciences of an essentially novel type.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Experiential sciences<sup>8</sup> are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sciences</span><span class="font17"> &quot;&quot;matters of fact.<sup>55</sup> The founding cognitional acts of experiencing posit something real </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">individually; </span><span class="font17">they posit it as something factually existing spatiotemporally, as something that is at </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font17"> temporal locus, that has this duration of its own and a reality-content which, with respect to its essence, could just as well have been at any other temporal locus. On the other hand, it is posited as something that is at this place, in this physical shape (or else is given in union with something organismal having this shape), whereas the same real something considered with respect to its own essence could just as well be at any other place and have</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">9</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">any other shape, could also be changing though it is in fact unchanging, or could be changing otherwise than in the manner in which it is changing in fact. Individual existence of every sort is, quite universally speaking, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^contingents</span><span class="font17"> It is thus; in respect of its essence it could be otherwise. Even though definite laws of Nature obtain according to which if such and such real circumstances exist in fact then such and such definite consequences must exist in fact, such laws express only </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font17"> rules which themselves could read quite otherwise. Moreover, they already presuppose, as something pertaining from the start to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of objects of possible experience, that objects of possible experience which are governed by them are, considered in themselves, contingent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But the sense of this contingency, which is called factualness, is limited in that it is correlative to a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessity</span><span class="font17"> which does not signify the mere </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font17"> existence of an obtaining rule of coordination among spatiotemporal matters of fact but rather has the character of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic necessity</span><span class="font17"> and with this a relation to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic universality.</span><span class="font17"> When we said that any matter of fact, &quot;in respect of its own essence,<sup>55</sup> could be otherwise, we were already saying that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">it belongs to the sense of anything contingent to have an essence and therefore an Eidos which can be apprehended purely;</span><span class="font17"> and this Eidos comes under </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic truths belonging to different levels &quot;universality,</span><span class="font17"> An individual object is not merely an individual object as such, a &quot;This here J an object never repeatable; as qualit-ied </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^in itself<sup>y</sup></span><span class="font17"> thus and so, it has its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">own specific character,</span><span class="font17"> its stock of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essential</span><span class="font17"> predicables which must belong to it (as &quot;an existent such as it is in itself') if other, secondary, relative<sup>9</sup> determinations can belong</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">This seeing which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">presentive</span><span class="font17"> of the essence<sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">and, perhaps, presentive of it originarily,</span><span class="font17"> can be an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">adequate</span><span class="font17"> one such as we can easily obtain in, for example, a seeing of the essence tone.

<p><span class="font17">For the present it is sufficient to point out that it is essentially impossible for even the spatial shape of the physical thing to be given otherwise than in mere one-sided adumbrations and that — regardless of this inadequateness which remains continually, despite all gain, throughout any course of continued intuitions——each physical property draws us into infinities of experience: that every experiential multiplicity, no matter how extensive, still leaves open more precise and novel determinations of the physical thing; and it does so </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in infinitum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Of whatever sort intuition of something individual may be, whether it be adequate or inadequate, it can take the turn into seeing an essence; and this seeing, whether it be correspondingly adequate or correspondingly inadequate, has the characteristic of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">presentive </span><span class="font17">act. But the following is implicit in this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The essence ( Eidos) is a new sort of object. Just as the datum of individual or experiencing intuition is an individual object, so the datum of eidetic intuition is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> pure essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Not a merely external analogy but a radical community is present here. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Seeing an essence is also precisely intuition<sub>y</sub>]\ist</span><span class="font17"> as an eidetic object is precisely an object. The universalization of the correlatively interrelated concepts &quot;intuition&quot; and &quot;object&quot; is not an arbitrary conceit but compellingly demanded by the nature of the matters in question.<sup>13</sup> Empirical intuition or, specifically, experience, is consciousness of an individual object; and as an intuitive consciousness it &quot;makes this object given,&quot; as perception it makes an individual object given originarily in the consciousness of seizing upon this object &quot;originarily,&quot; in its &quot;personal&quot; selfhood. In quite the same manner</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">intuition of an essence is consciousness of something, an &quot;object,&quot; a Something to which the intuitional regard is directed and which is &quot;itselfgiven&quot; in the intuition; it is something which can, however, be &quot;objectivated&quot; as well in other acts, something that can be thought of vaguely or distinctly, which can be made the subject of true and false predications — just like any other </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;object” in the necessarily broadened sense proper to formal logic.</span><span class="font17"> Any possible object — logically speaking, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>&lt;c</sup>any subject of possible true predications&quot;</span><span class="font17"> — has, prior to all predicative thinking, precisely </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font17"> modes ofbecoming the object of an objectivating, an intuiting regard which perhaps reaches it in its ''personal selfhood J which &quot;seizes upon&quot; it. Seeing an essence </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is </span><span class="font17">therefore intuition; and if it is seeing in the pregnant sense and not a mere and perhaps vague making present, the seeing is an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originarily </span><span class="font17">presentive intuition, seizing upon the essence in its &quot;personal&quot; selfhood.<sup>14</sup> On the other hand, it is an intuition of an essentially </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">peculiar </span><span class="font17">&lt;12&gt; and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">novel sort</span><span class="font17"> in contrast to the sorts of intuition which correlatively belong to objectivities ofother categories and especially in contrast to intuition in the usual and narrower sense, that is, intuition of something individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Certainly its own specific character is such that intuition of essence has as its basis a principal part of intuition of something individual, namely an appearing, a sightedness ofsomething individual, though not indeed a seizing upon this nor any sort of positing as an actuality; certainly, in consequence of that, no intuition of essence is possible without the free possibility of turning one's regard to a &quot;correspond-ing<sup>,5</sup> individual and forming a consciousness of an example —just as, conversely, no intuition of something individual is possible without the free possibility ofbringing about an ideation and, in it, directing one's regard to the corresponding essence exemplified in what is individually sighted; but this in no respect alters the fact that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the two sorts of intuition are essentially different;</span><span class="font17"> and propositions such as we have just stated indicate only the essential relations between them. To the essential differences between the intuitions there correspond the essential relationships between &quot;existence&quot; (here obviously in the sense of individual factual existent) and &quot;essence,&quot; between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">matter of</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">The Eidos, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure essence,</span><span class="font17"> can be exemplified for intuition in experiential data — in data of perception, memory, and so forth; but it can equally well be exemplified in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">data of mere phantasy.</span><span class="font17"> Accordingly, to seize upon an essence itself, and to seize upon it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originarily,</span><span class="font17"> we can start from corresponding experiencing intuitions, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">but equally well from intuitions which are non-experiencing, which do not seize upon factual existence but which are instead <sup>&lt;(</sup>merely imaginative^.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">If we produce in free phantasy spatial formations, melodies, social practices, and the like, or if we phantasy acts of experiencing of liking or disliking, of</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">13</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">willing, etc., then on that basis by &quot;ideation&quot; we can see various pure essences originarily and perhaps even adequately: either the essence &quot;&nbsp;any</span><span class="font17"> spatial shape </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">whatever, any</span><span class="font17"> melody </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">whatever, any</span><span class="font17"> social practice </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">whatever,</span><span class="font17"> etc., or the essence of a shape, a melody, etc., of the particular </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">type</span><span class="font17"> exemplified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this connection, it does not matter whether anything of the sort has ever been given in actual experience or not. If, by some psychological miracle or other, free phantasy should lead to the imagination of data (sensuous data, for example) of an essentially novel sort such as never have occurred and never will occur in any experience, that would in no respect alter the originary givenness of the corresponding essences: though imagined Data are never actual Data.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">Let us start withjudgments. Stated more precisely, it is a matter of the difference between judgments </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">about</span><span class="font17"> essences and judgments which, in an indeterminately universal manner and without admixture of positings of the individual nevertheless judge in the mode </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Any [Uberhaupt] about the individual, though purely as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> single particular (subsumed unde</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">，</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;</span><span class="font17"> essences </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Einzelheit der Wesen\</span><span class="font17">. Thus in pure geometry we do not judge, as a rule, about the Eidos straight line, angle, triangle, conic section, or the like, but rather about any straight line</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">^Translator's note:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> For justification for translating &quot;Einzelheit der Wesen&quot; as &quot;single particular subsumed under an essence/' see below, §13, where Husserl distinguishes between the &quot;subsumption” of an individual under an essence in the sense either of an infima species or a genus, and the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">subordination</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> of an essence to its higher species or genus. It is clear that here Husserl speaks of an individual in the sense of a single particular with respect to the infima species or genus (depending on the example). Ricoeur translates &quot;Einzelheit der Wesen&quot; as “cas particulier des essences/' p. 26; Gaos as &quot;caso singular de las esencias,&quot; p. 24; and Boyce Gibson as &quot;instance of essential being,&quot; p. 58. None of these translations would seem to express the distinction Husserl makes; there seems to be no reason for translating &quot;Wesen&quot; as &quot;essential being” since Husserl distinguishes essence from being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">whatever, any angle whatever — or about a straight line, an angle, or &quot;as a straight line,&quot; &quot;as an angle J about any individual triangles whatever, any conic sections whatever. Such universal judgments have the characteristic of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic universality,</span><span class="font17"> &quot;pure&quot; or, as it is also called, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^strict^ absolutely <sup>li</sup>unconditional universality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For the sake of simplicity let us assume that it is a matter of &quot;axioms,&quot; immediately evident judgments to which indeed all the otherjudgments in a mediate grounding lead back. Provided that, as presupposed here, they judge in the above-stated manner about individual single particulars, such judgments need for their noetic grounding — i.e., in order to make them matters of insight — a certain seeing of essences which one could designate also (in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">modified </span><span class="font17">sense) as a seizing upon essences</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> and this seeing too, like the eidetic intuition which makes essences objects, is based on sighting but not on experiencing individual single particulars &lt;subsumed unden the essences. For such judgments, too, more phantasy-objectivations, or rather individuals sighted in phantasy, are sufficient. There is consciousness of what is sighted, as sighted; it &quot;appears&quot; but is not seized upon as factually existent. If, for example, we judge with eidetic universality (&quot;unconditional&quot; universality, &quot;pure&quot; universality), &quot;Any color whatever is different from any sound whatever,&quot; the statement just made can be confirmed by examining ourjudging. A single &lt;subsumed unden the essence color and a &lt;single subsumed) under the essence sound are intuitionally &quot;objective&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">\^^vorstelli^} as </span><span class="font17">singles subsumed under their essences; phantasy-intuition (without a positing of factual existence) and eidetic intuition are there at the same time in a certain manner; but the latter intuition is not there as one which makes the essence an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">object.</span><span class="font17"> It is, however, of the essence of the situation which we are at all times free to shift to the corresponding Objectivating attitude, that this shifting is precisely an essential possibility. In accord with the altered attitude, the judgment would be altered; it would then state: The essence (the &quot;genus&quot;) color is other than the essence (the genus) sound. And so everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Conversely, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any judgment about essences can be converted into an equivalent unconditionally universal judgment about single particulars</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">〈</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">subsumed under&gt; essences as single particulars subsumed under essences [dieser Wesen als solches]</span><span class="font17">. In this manner, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">judgments concerning what is purely essential </span><span class="font17">(purely eidetic judgments) belong </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">together, no matter what their logical</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">15</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">form</span><span class="font17"> may be.

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§6 . Some Fundamental Concepts. Universality and Necessity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">It is now apparent that the following ideas belong together: eidetic judg</span><span class="font11">，</span><span class="font17">zzg, eidetic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">judgment</span><span class="font17"> or asserted eidetic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">proposition,</span><span class="font17"> eidetic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">truth </span><span class="font17">(or true proposition); as correlate of the last idea: the eidetic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pre-dicatively formed affair-complex</span><span class="font17"> simpliciter (as what obtains in eidetic truth); finally, as correlate of the first ideas: the eidetic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">predicatively formed affair-complex</span><span class="font17"> in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">modified</span><span class="font17"> sense of merely what is meant, in the sense of the judged as judged which can either obtain or not obtain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Any eidetic particularization and singularization of an eidetically universal predicatively formed affair-complex, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in so far as</span><span class="font17"> it is that, is called an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic necessity. Eidetic universality and eidetic necessity are</span><span class="font17"> therefore correlates. But the use of the word &quot;necessity” varies following the interrelated correlations: the corresponding judgments are also called necessary. It is important, however, to heed the distinctions and above all not to designate eidetic universality a necessity (as people usually do). The consciousness of a necessity, more particularly a judging consciousness in which there is consciousness of a predicatively formed affair-complex as a particularization of an eidetic universality, is called an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">apodictic</span><span class="font17"><sup>18</sup> consciousness; thejudgment itself the asserted proposition, is called an apodictic (also an apodictically &quot;necessary”) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consequence</span><span class="font17"> of the universal judgment with which it is connected. The stated propositions about the relations among universality, necessity, and apodicticity can be framed more universally so that they hold good for any, and not only for purely eidetic, spheres. Obviously, however, they require a distinctive and particularly important sense </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">within the eidetic limitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The combination of an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic judging</span><span class="font17"> about any individual whatever with a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positing of the factual existence</span><span class="font17"> of something individual is also very important. The eidetic universality becomes transferred to an individual posited as factually existing, or to an indeterminately universal sphere of individuals (which undergoes positing as factu-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">ally existent). Every &quot;application&quot; of geometrical truths to cases in Nature (Nature, posited as actual) belongs here. The predicatively formed affair-complex, posited as actual, is then a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">matter of fact</span><span class="font17"> in so far as it is an individual predicatively formed actuality-complex; it is, &lt;16&gt; however, an eidetic necessity in so far as it is a singularization of an eidetic universality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unrestricted universality of natural laws</span><span class="font17"> must not be mistaken for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic universality.</span><span class="font17"> To be sure, the proposition, ''All bodies are heavy,&quot; posits no definite physical affair as factually existing within the totality of Nature. Still it does not have the unconditional universality of eidetically universal propositions because, according to its sense as a law of Nature, it carries with it a positing of factual existence, that is to say, of Nature itself of spatiotemporal actuality: All bodies — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in Nature,</span><span class="font17"> all &quot;actual&quot; bodies — are heavy. In contradistinction, the proposition, <sup>4</sup>'A11 material things are extended,<sup>5,</sup> has eidetic validity and can be understood as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely</span><span class="font17"> eidetic proposition provided that the positing of factual existence, carried out on the side of the subject, is suspended. It states something that is grounded purely in the essence of a material thing and in the essence of extension and that we can make evident as having &quot;unconditional&quot; universal validity. We do this by making the essence of the material thing something given originarily (perhaps on the basis of a free phantasying<sup>19</sup> of a material thing) in order, then, in this presentive consciousness, to perform the steps of thinking which the &quot;insight,&quot; the originary givenness of the predicatively formed eidetic affaircomplex explicitly set down by that proposition, requires. That </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">something actual</span><span class="font17"> in space corresponds to truths of that sort is not a mere fact; instead, it is an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic necessity</span><span class="font17"> as a particularization of eidetic laws. Only the actual thing itself, to which the application is made, is a matter of fact here.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">The ground for a corresponding interrelation between sciences of matters of fact and eidetic sciences is the connection (itself eidetic) obtaining between individual object and essence, according to which an essential composition belongs to each individual object as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">essence<sup>20</sup> — just as, conversely, to each essence there correspond possible individua which would be its factual singularizations. There are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure eidetic sciences</span><span class="font17"> such as pure logic, pure mathematics, and the pure theories of time, space, motion, and so forth. Throughout, in every step of their thinking, they are pure of all positings of matters of fact; or, equivalently: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in them no experience, as experience,</span><span class="font17"> that is, as a consciousness that seizes upon or posits actuality, factual existence, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can assume thefunction of grounding.</span><span class="font17"> Where experience functions in them &lt;17&gt; it does not function </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font17"> experience. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">geometer</span><span class="font17"> who draws his figures on the board produces thereby factually existing lines on the factually existing board. But his experiencing of the product, qua experiencing, no more </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">grounds</span><span class="font17"> his geometrical seeing of essences and eidetic thinking than does his physical producing. This is why it does not matter whether his experiencing is hallucination or whether, instead of actually drawing his lines and constructions, he imagines them in a world of phantasy. It is quite otherwise in the case of the scientific </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">investigator &quot;Nature.</span><span class="font17"> He observes and experiments; that is, he ascertains </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">factual existence</span><span class="font17"> according to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">experience; for him experiencing is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> grounding act</span><span class="font17"> which can never be substituted by a mere imagining. And this is precisely why science of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">matters of fact</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">experiential</span><span class="font17"> science are equivalent concepts. But for the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">geometer</span><span class="font17"> who explores not actualities but &quot;ideal possibilities/<sup>5</sup> not predicatively formed actuality-complexes but predicatively formed eidetic affaircomplexes, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the ultimately grounding act</span><span class="font17"> is not experience but rather </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the seeing of essences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So it is in all eidetic sciences. Grounded on the predicatively formed eidetic affair-complexes (or the eidetic axioms), seized upon in immediate insight, are the mediate, predicatively formed eidetic affair-complexes which become given in a thinking with mediated insight — a thinking according to principles, all of which are objects of immediate insight. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Consequently each step in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> mediate grounding is apodictically and eidetically necessary.</span><span class="font17"> The essence of purely eidetic science thus consists of proceeding in an exclusively eidetic way; from the start and subsequently, the only predicatively formed affaircomplexes are such as have eidetic validity and can therefore be either made originarily given immediately (as grounded immediately in essences originarily seen) or else can become &quot;inferred'' from</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">such &quot;axiomatic&quot; predicatively formed affair-complexes by pure deduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Connected with this is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">practical ideal&quot;exact eidetic science</span><span class="font17"> which, strictly speaking, only recent mathematics has shown how to actualize:<sup>21</sup> it has shown how to bestow on any eidetic science the highest degree of rationality by reducing all of its mediate steps of thinking to mere subsumptions under the axioms of the particular eidetic province, these axioms having been assembled once for all and reinforced with the whole set of axioms belonging to <sup>t&lt;</sup>^^rmal^^ or &quot;pure''logic (in the broadest sense: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mathesis universalis^<sup>2</sup>)</span><span class="font17"> — unless, of course, from the very beginning it is a matter of that logic itself</span></p>

Since, like any other science, an experiential science is directed to objects, it must be universally bound by the laws that belong to the essence of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">anything objective whatever.</span><span class="font17"> It thereby enters into a relation with the complex of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal-ontological</span><span class="font17"> disciplines which, besides formal logic in the narrower sense, embraces the other disciplines of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;mathesis universalis<sup>,y</sup></span><span class="font17"> (for example arithmetic, pure analysis, theory o f multiplicities). Moreover, in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font17"> place, any matter of fact includes a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">material</span><span class="font17"> essential composition; and any eidetic truth belonging to the pure essences comprised in that composition must yield a law by which the given factual singularity, like any other possible singularity, is bound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">19</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§9. Region and Regional Eidetics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Any concrete empirical objectivity finds its place within a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">highest </span><span class="font17">material genus, a &quot;region J of empirical objects. To the pure regional essence, then, there corresponds a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">regional eidetic science</span><span class="font17"> or, as we can also say, a regional ontology. In this connection we assume that the regional essence, or the different genera composing it, are the basis for such abundant and highly ramified cognitions that, with respect to their systematic explication, it is indeed worth speaking of a science or of a whole complex of ontological disciplines corresponding to the single generic components of the region. We shall be able to convince ourselves amply of the great extent to which this presupposition is in fact fulfilled. According to what we were saying, any empirical science belonging to the extension of a region will be essentially related not only to the formal but also to the regional, ontological disciplines. We can also express this as follows: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Any science of matters of fact</span><span class="font17"> (any experiential science) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">has essential theoretical foundations in eidetic ontologies.</span><span class="font17"> For (in case the assumption made is correct) it is quite obvious that the abundant stock of cognitions relating in a pure, an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unconditionally</span><span class="font17"> valid manner to all possible objects of the region ——in so far as these cognitions belong partly to the empty form of any objectivity whatever and partly to the regional Eidos which, as it were, exhibits a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessary material form</span><span class="font17"> of all the objects in the region — cannot lack significance for the exploration of empirical facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this manner there corresponds, e.g., to all the disciplines comprised in natural science, the eidetic science of any physical Nature whatever </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[the ontology of Nature),</span><span class="font17"> since there corresponds to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">de facto </span><span class="font17">Nature an Eidos that can be apprehended purely, the &quot;essence'' </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Any Nature Whatever,</span><span class="font17"> with an infinite abundance of predicatively formed eidetic affair-complexes included in the latter. Ifwe fashion </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the idea of </span><span class="font17">a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">perfectly rationalized experiential science</span><span class="font17"> of Nature, i.e., one so far advanced in its theorization that every particular included in it has been traced back to that particular's most universal and essential grounds, then it is clear </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">that the realization of that idea essentially depends on the elaboration of the corresponding eidetic sciences;</span><span class="font17"> that is to say, it depends not only on the elaboration </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of formal mathesis,</span><span class="font17"> which is related in one &lt;20&gt; and the same manner to all sciences taken universally, but especially on the elaboration of those </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">disciplines of material ontology</span><span class="font17"> which explicate with rational purity, i.e., eidetically, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of Nature and therefore the essences of all essential sorts of natural objectivities as such. And obviously that holds for any other region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Also with regard to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">cognitive practice</span><span class="font17"> it is to be expected beforehand that the closer an experiential science comes to the &quot;rational'' level, the level of &quot;exact,'' of nomological science — thus the higher the degree to which an experiential science is provided with developed eidetic disciplines as its fundamentals and utilizes them for its (cognitive) groundings — the greater will become the scope and power of its cognitive-practical performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This is confirmed by the development of the rational natural sciences, the physical sciences ofNature. Their great era began in the modern age precisely when the geometry which had already been highly developed as a pure eidetics in antiquity (and chiefly in the Platonic school) was all at once made fruitful in the grand style for the method of physics. People made clear to themselves that the material thing is essentially </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">res extensa</span><span class="font17"> and that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">geometry is therefore the ontological discipline relating to an essential moment of material thinghood, </span><span class="font17">namely </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the spatial form.</span><span class="font17"> But, in addition, people also made it clear to themselves that the universal (in our terminology, the regional) essence of the material thing extends much further. This is shown by the fact that the development followed at the same time along the line that led to the elaborating of a series of new disciplines coordinate with geometry and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">called on to perform the same Junction, that of rationalizing the empirical</span><span class="font17"> The magnificent flowering of the formal and material mathematical sciences sprang from this aim. With passionate zeal</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">these sciences were developed, or newly constructed, as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely</span><span class="font17"> &quot;ra</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> tional&quot; sciences (as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic ontologies</span><span class="font17"> in our sense), and indeed (in the beginnings of the modern age and for a long time after) not for their own sake but for the sake of the empirical sciences. They then abundantly bore the hoped-for fruits in the parallel development of that much-admired science, rational physics.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§10 . Region and Category. The Analytic Region and its Categories.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">If we put ourselves in the position of an investigator in any eidetic </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">21</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">science, e.g., the ontology of Nature, we find that (indeed, that is the normal case) we are directed not to essences as objects but to objects subsumed under essences which, in our example, are subordinate to the region Nature. In this connection, we observe, however, that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;object&quot;</span><span class="font17"> is a name for various formations which nonetheless belong together — for example, '&quot;physical thing,&quot; &quot;property,&quot; &quot;relationship,&quot; &quot;predicatively formed af^ai^-complex,^<sup>,</sup> **aggregate,<sup>J, c&lt;</sup>orde-red set.&quot; Obviously they are not on a par with one another but rather in every case point back to one kind of objectivity that, so to speak, takes precedence as the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">primal objectivity,</span><span class="font17"> whereas all the others offer themselves as, in a way, merely its modifications. Naturally in our example the physical thing itself takes this precedence in contradistinction to the physical property, the physical relationship, etc. But precisely this is part of that formal structure which must undergo clarification if the terms &quot;object&quot; and &quot;object-region&quot; are not to remain in a state of confusion. From that clarification, to which we devote the following observations, the important </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">concept of category, </span><span class="font17">related to the concept of region, will automatically result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the one hand, category is a word which, in the phrase </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^category of</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">region</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> points back precisely to the region in question, e.g., to the region Physical Nature. On the other hand, however, it relates the particular determined </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">material region</span><span class="font17"> to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">form</span><span class="font17"> of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any region whatever </span><span class="font17">or, equivalently, to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal essence of any object whatever</span><span class="font17"> and to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>iC</sup>formal categories&quot;</span><span class="font17"> pertaining to this essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us begin with a not unimportant remark. At first formal ontology seems to be coordinate with material ontologies provided that the formal essence of any object whatever and the regional essences seem to play like roles (in formal ontology and in the regional</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ontologies respectively). One is therefore inclined to speak not simply of regions, as we have up to now, but instead of material regions and now, in addition, of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^formal region ^</span><span class="font17"> If we accept this manner of speaking, we must be rather cautious. On the one side stand </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">material</span><span class="font17"> essences; and in a certain sense they are the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>((</sup>essences proper.<sup>},</sup></span><span class="font17"> But on the other side there stands something that is indeed eidetic but which, nevertheless, differs in its fundamental essence: a mere </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence~form,</span><span class="font17"> which is indeed an essence but completely &quot;c</span><span class="font7">加》勿</span><span class="font17">&quot;</span><span class="font11">，</span><span class="font17"> an essence that, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the manner pertaining to an empty form, fits all possible essences;</span><span class="font17"> it is an essence which, with its formal universality, has all material universalities, even the highest of them, under it and prescribes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">laws</span><span class="font17"> for them by virtue of the formal truths pertaining to its formal universality. Therefore the so-called </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">''formal region&quot;</span><span class="font17"> is, after all, not something co-ordinate with the material regions (the regions</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">22</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">simpliciter); </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">properly it is not</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">region but the empty form of any region whatever;</span><span class="font17"> all the regions, with all their materially filled eidetic particularizations stand, not alongside it, but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">under</span><span class="font17"> it — though only formally. This subordination of the material to the formal is shown by the circumstance that</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal ontology contains theforms of all ontologies (scL</span><span class="font17"> all ontologies &quot;proper,&quot; all &quot;materiaP'ontologies) and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">prescribes </span><span class="font17">for material ontologies a</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal structure common to them all</span><span class="font17">— including that structure which we must now study with a view to the distinction between region and category.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us start from formal ontology (always as pure logic in its full extent as mathesis universalis) which, as we know, is the eidetic science of any object whatever. Anything and everything is an object in the sense proper to formal ontology, and an infinity of various truths, distributed among the many disciplines of mathesis, can be established for it. But they all lead back to a small stock ofimmediate or &quot;fundamental'' truths which function as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>{t</sup>axioms&quot;</span><span class="font17"> in the disciplines of pure logic. We define now as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">logical categories or categories of the logical region, any object whatever:</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fundamental concepts of pure logic </span><span class="font17">which occur in those axioms ——the concepts by means of which, in the total set of axioms, the logical essence of any object whatever becomes determined, or the concepts which express the unconditionally necessary and constituent determinations of an object as object, of anything whatever in so far as it can be something at all. Because the purely logical, in the sense delimited by us with absolute exactness, determines that concept of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>iQ</sup>analytic &quot;^3^</span><span class="font17"> contrasted with</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">^author's footnote: cf. </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen<sub>y</sub></span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Vol. II, &quot;Third Investigation/* §§IIff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Synthetic</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> which alone is important (but which is important fundamentally) to philosophy, we may also designate these categories as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">analytic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Accordingly, concepts such as property, relative determination, predicatively formed affair-complex, relationship, identity, equality, aggregate (collection), cardinal number, whole and part, genus and species, and the like, are examples of logical categories. But the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>cc</sup>signification-categories,<sup>&gt;y</sup></span><span class="font17"> the fundamental concepts belonging to the essence of the proposition (apophansis) — the fundamental &lt;23&gt; concepts of different kinds of propositions, proposition-members, and propositions-forms ——also belong here. They belong here, moreover, according to our definition in view of the eidetic truths that connect &quot;any object whatever<sup>55</sup> and &quot;any signification whatever<sup>5 5</sup> so that, furthermore, pure signification-truths can be converted into pure object-truths. For that very reason </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>C(</sup>apophantic Logic</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">' </span><span class="font17">although it makes statements exclusively about significations, is nevertheless part of formal ontology in the fully comprehensive sense. Still one must set the signification-categories apart as a group by themselves and contrast them with the others as the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal objective categories</span><span class="font17"> in the pregnant sense.<sup>26</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It may also be noted that by categories we can understand, on the one hand, the concepts in the sense of significations but, on the other hand the formal essences themselves which find their expression in those significations. For example, the &quot;category&quot; predicatively formed affair-complex, plurality, and the like, understood in the latter sense, is the formal Eidos any predicatively formed affaircomplex whatever, any plurality whatever, and the like. The ambiguity is dangerous only as long as one has not learned to separate cleanly the things that must be separated throughout: ''signification&quot; and that which can undergo &quot;expression&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font17"> signification; and, again, signification and signified objectivity.

<p><span class="font17">In the realm of any objectivities whatever there is need now of an important distinction that is mirrored within the theory of the forms of significations by the (&quot;pure-grammatical&quot;) distinction between &quot;syntactical forms&quot; and ''syntactical substrates&quot; or &quot;stuffk&quot; As a consequence, a separation of the categories of formal ontology into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">syntactical categories</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">su bstra te-ca tegories</span><span class="font17"> makes itselfknown; and </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">24</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">this separation will now be discussed in greater detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">By </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">syntactical objectivities</span><span class="font17"> we mean objects derived from other objectivities by means </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of<sup>Ci</sup> syntactical forms'</span><span class="font17"> The categories corresponding to these forms we shall call </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">syntactical categories.</span><span class="font17"> Among them belong, for instance, categories such as predicatively formed affair-complexes<sub>r</sub> relationship, condition or quality, unit, plurality, cardinal number, ordered set, ordinal number, etc. The eidetic situation obtaining here may be described as follows: Every object, in so far as it can be explicated, related to other objects or, in short, logically determined, takes on various syntactical forms; as correlates of the determining thinking, objectivities of a higher level become constituted; conditions, or qualities, and objects determined by conditions or qualities, relationships between some objects or other, pluralities of units, members of ordered sets, objects as bearers of ordinal numerical determinations, etc. If the thinking is predicative, there accrue, step by step, expressions and relevant apophantic signification-formations which mirror the syntactical objectivities with respect to all the articulations and forms of the latter, in precisely corresponding significational syntaxes. Like any other objectivities, all those &quot;categorial objectivities<sup>,</sup></span><span class="font11"><sup>，</sup></span><span class="font17"><sup>2?</sup> can function as substrates of categorial formations which, in turn, can do the same, etc. Conversely, every such formation evidently refers back to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ultimate substrates,</span><span class="font17"> to objects of a first or lowest level; i.e., to objects </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">which are no longer synlactical-categorial formations,</span><span class="font17"> which no longer contain any of those ontological forms which are mere correlates of the thinking functions</span></p>

Accordingly the formal region, any objectivity whatever, is divided into ultimate substrates and syntactical objectivities. The latter we shall call </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">syntactical derivatives<sup>2</sup>^</span><span class="font17"> of the corresponding substrates, among which, as we shall soon hear, all “individuals&quot; belong.

<p><span class="font17">The following should also be noted. One reaches the ultimate, syntactically formless substrates likewise from the standpoint of the theory of forms of significations: Any proposition or any possible &lt;25&gt; member of a proposition contains, as the substrates of its apophantic forms, its so-called “terms.&quot; These can be terms in a merely relative sense; that is to say, they can themselves contain forms (e.g., the plural form, attributives, etc.<sup>29</sup>). But in every case we get back — necessarily — to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ultimate terms,</span><span class="font17"> ultimate substrates, which contain no syntactical formation at all.<sup>30,31</sup></span></p>

Descending, we arrive at the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">infimae species</span><span class="font17"> or, as we also say, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic singularities;</span><span class="font17"> ascending through the specific and generic essences, we arrive at a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">highest genus.</span><span class="font17"> Eidetic singularities are essences which necessarily have over them &quot;more universal&quot; essences as their genera, but do not have under them any particularizations in relation to which they would themselves be species (either proximate species or mediate, higher, genera). In like fashion, that genus is the highest which has no genus over it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this sense, within the realm of pure logic which is made up of significations, the highest genus is &quot;any signification whatever;&quot; each determinate proposition-form, and each determinate form of a proposition-member, is an eidetic singularity</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> any proposition whatever is an intermediate genus. In the same fashion, any cardinal number whatever is a highest genus. Two, three, etc. are its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">infimae species</span><span class="font17"> or eidetic singularities. In the sphere of materially filled essences we find as examples of highest genera any physical thing whatever and any sensuous quality, any spatial shape, and any mental process whatever; the eidetic compositions belonging to the determinate physical things and to the determinate sensuous qualities, spatial shapes, and mental processes, as qualities, shapes, and processes, are eidetic and accordingly materially filled singularities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">These</span><span class="font17"> eidetic relationships designated by Genus and Species (not the relationships among classes, i.e., sets) are such that, in the &lt;26&gt; particular essence, the more universal essence is &quot;immediately or mediately </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">contained<sup>3</sup>^</span><span class="font17"> — in a determined sense, the character of which can be seized upon in eidetic intuition. For that reason many investigators include the relationship of an eidetic genus or species to its eidetic particularization among the relationships of &quot;part&quot; to &quot;whole.&quot; &quot;Whole and part&quot; then expresses the broadest concept of &quot;that which contains and that which is contained,<sup>M</sup> of which the eidetic species-relationship is a particularity. The eidetically singular essence </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[eidetisch Singulare]</span><span class="font17"> thus implies collectively the universals lying above it and which, for their part, level by level, 'lie one inside another/<sup>5</sup> the higher always lying inside the lower.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§13 . Generalization and Formalization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">One must sharply distinguish the relationships belonging to generalization and specialization from the essentially heterogeneous relationships belonging, on the one hand, to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universalization of something materially filled into the formal in the sense ^pure logic</span><span class="font17"> and, on the other hand, to the converse: the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">materialization</span><span class="font17"> of something logically formal. In other words: generalization is something totally different from that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formalization</span><span class="font17"> which plays such a large role in, e.g., mathematical analysis; and specialization is something totally different from </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">de^formalization,</span><span class="font17"> from &quot;filling out&quot; an empty logico-mathe-matical form or a formal truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Accordingly, the subordinating of an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> to the formal universality </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">?l</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure-logical</span><span class="font17"> essence must not be mistaken for the subordinating of an essence to its higher essential </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">genera.</span><span class="font17"> Thus, e.g., the essence, triangle, is subordinate to the summum genus, Spatial Shape; and the essence, red, to the summum genus, Sensuous Quality. On the other hand, red, triangle and similarly all other essences, whether homogeneous or heterogeneous, are subordinate to the categorial heading &quot;essence'' which, with respect to all of them, by no means has the characteristic of an essential genus; it rather does </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font17"> have that characteristic relative to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font17"> of them. To regard &quot;essence'' as the genus of materially filled essences would be just as wrong as to misinterpret any object whatever (the empty Something) as the genus with respect to objects of all sorts and, therefore, naturally as simply the one and only summum genus, the genus of all genera. On the contrary, all the categories of formal ontology must be designated as eidetic singularities that have their summum genus in the essence, &quot;any category whatever of formal ontology.<sup>M</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is clear, similarly, that any determinate inference, e.g., one ancillary to physics, is a singularization of a determinate purely </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">27</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">logical form ofinference, that any determinate proposition in physics is a singularization of a propositional form, and the like. The pure forms, however, are not genera relatively to the materially filled propositions or inferences, but are themselves only infimae species, namely of the purely logical genera, proposition, inference, which, like all similar genera, have as their absolutely highest genus &quot;any signification whatever.'^ The filling out of an empty logical form</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">(and mathesis universalis includes nothing but empty forms) is therefore an &quot;operation&quot; entirely different in contrast to genuine specialization down to the infimae species. This can be ascertained throughout; thus, e.g., the transition from space to &quot;Euclidean manifold'' is not a generalization but a &quot;fbrmal'' universalization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To verify this radical separation we must, as in all such cases, go back to eidetic intuition which at once teaches us that logical formessences (e.g., the categories) are not &quot;inherent&quot; in the materially filled singularizations in the same manner in which the universal, red, is &quot;inherent&quot; in the different nuances of red, or in which &quot;color&quot; is inherent in red or blue, and that they are not, in the proper sense, &quot;in&quot; the materially filled singularizations at all — i.e., not in any sense that would have enough in common with the usual narrow sense of a part-relationship to justify speaking of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">containedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">No detailed exposition is needed to show, likewise, that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">subsumption</span><span class="font17"> of an individual, of any This-here, under an essence (a subsumption whose characteristic varies and depends on whether an infima species or a genus is involved) must not be mistaken for the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">subordination</span><span class="font17"> of an essence to its higher species or to a genus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the same way we shall merely indicate the changing use of the word </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">extensions,</span><span class="font17"> especially with reference to the function of essences in the universal judgment — a use which obviously must be differentiated in accord with the differences just explained. Any essence which is not an infima species has an<sup>35</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic extension,</span><span class="font17"> an extension made up of specificities and always ultimately of eidetic singularities. Any formal essence has, on the other hand, its formal or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">''mathematical<sup>J</sup> extension.</span><span class="font17"> Furthermore, any essence whatever has its extension of individual singularizations, an ideal sum-total of possible This-heres to which it can be related in cidctically universal thinking. The phrase, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">empirical extension,</span><span class="font17"> indicates more than that: namely, the restriction to a sphere </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^factual being</span><span class="font17"> by virtue of a combined positing offactual being annulling the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure</span><span class="font17"> universality. All this is transferred, naturally, from essences to &quot;concepts&quot; as significations.</span></p>

The latter class is itself by no means empty or poverty-stricken; it is determined, that is to say, as the totality of the predicatively formed affair-complexes belonging to the realm of pure logic as mathesis universalis, with all the categorial objectivities out of which they are constructed. Thus every predicatively formed affair-complex expressed by some syllogistic or arithmetical axiom or theorem, every form of inference, every number, every numerical formation, every function in pure analysis, and every Euclidean or non-Euclidean manifold well-defined, belongs in this class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we now concentrate on the class of materially filled objectivities, we arrive at </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ultimate materially filled substrates</span><span class="font17"> as the cores of all syntactical formations. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">substrate-categories</span><span class="font17"> belong to these cores and find their place under the two disjunctive main headings: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^materially filled ultimate essence^</span><span class="font17"> and <sup>ff</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">This here!^</span><span class="font17"> or pure, syntactically formless, individual single particular. The term individuum, which suggests itself here, is unsuitable because, no matter how it might be defined, the indivisibility that the word connotes should not be admitted into the concept “This here!&quot; but rather must be reserved for the particular and quite indispensible concept individuum. Consequently, we take over the Aristotelian expression </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">tode ti</span><span class="font17"> which, at least according to the wording, does not include that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We have contrasted the formless ultimate essence and the This-here.

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§15 . Selfsufficient and Non-self sufficient Objects. Concretum and Individuum.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Yet another basic distinction is needed: that between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">selfsufficient</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">non-selfsufficient objects.</span><span class="font17"> For example, a categorial form is nonselfsufficient in so far as it necessarily refers back to a substrate whose form it is. Substrate and form are referred to one another and are </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">29</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">unthinkable “without each other.&quot; In this broadest sense, a purely logical form is thus non-selfsufficient; e.g., the categorial form, object, is non-selfsufficient with respect to all object-materials, the category, essence, is non-selfsufficient with respect to all determinate</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">essences</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> and so forth. Let us now set aside these non-selfsufficiences and relate a pregnant concept of non-selfsufficiency or selfsufficiency to concatenated &quot;contents&quot; proper, to relations of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">''containedness^ </span><span class="font7">&quot;〃应&quot;,‘‘ </span><span class="font17">and perchance </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^connectedness&quot;</span><span class="font17"> in a more proper sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Of particular interest here is the situation with the ultimate substrates and, still more narrowly conceived, with materially filled substrate-essences. Two possibilities arise for them: either one such substrate-essence grounds with another substrate-essence the unity of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> essence, or it does not do so. In the first case, we arrive at relationships, to be described more precisely, which are perhaps of unilateral or reciprocal non-selfsufficiency; and with respect to eidetic and individual single particulars falling under united essences, we arrive at the apodictically necessary consequence that single particulars falling under one essence cannot exist without being determined by essences which at least share a generic community with that of the other essences.<sup>36 37</sup> E.g., sensuous quality necessarily refers to some species or other of spread; spread is, again, necessarily the spread of some quality united with it, &quot;covering&quot; it. A moment, &quot;enhancement,&quot; e.g., under the category of intensity, is only possible as immanent in a qualitative content, and a content subsumed under such a (qualitative) genus is, in turn, not thinkable without some degree or other of enhancement. As a mental process of a certain generic determinateness, an appearing is impossible except as an appearing of something '&quot;apparent, as apparent;'' and, likewise, the converse holds. And so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As a result, we arrive at important definitions of the formal categorial concepts of individuum, concretum and abstractum. A non-selfsufficient essence is called an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">abstractum,</span><span class="font17"> an absolutely selfsufficient essence a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">concretum.</span><span class="font17"> A This-here, the material essence of which is a concretum, is called an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">individuum^</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A concretum is obviously an eidetic singularity because species and genera (expressions which ordinarily exclude the infima species) are non-selfsufficient on principle. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Eidetic singularities</span><span class="font17"> are divided into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">abstract</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">concrete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Eidetic singularities included discretely </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[disjunktiv}</span><span class="font17"> in a concretum are necessarily &quot;heterogeneous&quot; in view of the formal-ontological law that two eidetic singularities of one and the same genus cannot be combined into the unity ofomc essence;<sup>42</sup> or, as we also say: the infimae species of a genus are mutually &quot;incompatible.'' Accordingly, every singularity finding a place in a concretum, seen as an infima species, leads to a separated system of species and genera, thus also to separated summa genera. For instance, in the unity of a phenomenal thing the determinate shape leads to the summum genus of any spatial shape whatever, a determinate color to any visual quality whatever. Nonetheless, the infimae species in a concretum, instead of being discrete, can also be so related that one is comprehended in the other. For example, physical properties presuppose and include in themselves spatial determinations. In that case, the summa genera too are not, then, discrete</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As a further consequence, the genera are divided in characteristic and fundamental ways into those genera having concreta, (as infimae species,</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">under them, and into those having abstracta under them. For the sake of convenience we speak of concrete and abstract genera despite the double sense which the adjectives now acquire. Obviously no one would be inclined to take concrete genera themselves for concreta in the original sense. Where precision demands it, however, the unwieldly expression &quot;genera&quot; must be used respectively of concreta and of abstracta. Examples of concrete genera are real thing, visual phantom (sensuously filled appearing visual shape), mental process and the like. In contrast, spatial shape, visual quality and the like are examples of abstract genera.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Moreover, with the concepts individuum and concretum the concept of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">region,</span><span class="font17"> fundamental to the theory of science, is defined in a strictly &quot;analytical&quot; way. A region is nothing other than the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">total highest generic unity belonging to</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">concretum,</span><span class="font17"> i.e., the essentially unitary nexus of the summa genera pertaining to the infimae species within the &lt;31&gt; concretum. The eidetic extension of the region comprises the ideal totality of concretely unified complexes of infimae species belonging to these genera; the individual extension comprises the ideal totality of possible individua having such concrete essences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Each regional essence determines </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;synthetical eidetic truths, that is to say, truths that are grounded in it as this generic essence, but that are not mere particularizations of truths included in formal ontology.</span><span class="font17"> Accordingly, neither the regional concept nor any of its regional specifications is freely variable in these synthetical truths; the substitution ofindeter-minate terms for the related determinate ones does not yield a law of formal ontology, as it does, in characteristic fashion, in the case of any &quot;analytic&quot; necessity. The set of synthetical truths grounded in the regional essence makes up the content of the regional ontology. The total set </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">oifundamental</span><span class="font17"> truths among them, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">regional axioms,</span><span class="font17"> delimits —and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">defines</span><span class="font17"> for us — the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">set of regional categories.</span><span class="font17"> These concepts do not, like all concepts, merely express particularizations of the categories of pure logic, but rather are distinguished by the fact that they express, by virtue of the regional axioms, that which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">peculiar</span><span class="font17"> to the regional essence or, correlatively, express </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">with eidetic universality that which must belong, <sup>c(</sup>a priori'<sup>3</sup> and<sup>c(</sup>syntheticallyto an individual object within the extension of the region.</span><span class="font17"> Though such concepts do not belong to pure logic, their application to given individuals is apodictically and unconditionally necessary; it is governed, moreover, by the regional (synthetical) axioms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In order to retain the allusions to Kant's critique of reason (in spite of considerable differences in the fundamental conceptions, although the differences do not exclude a basic affinity), one would have to understand by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">synthetical cognitions</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">priori the regional axioms;</span><span class="font17"> and we should have as many irreducible classes of such cognitions as we have regions. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>ci</sup> synthetical fundamental concepts,<sup>9,</sup></span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">categories,</span><span class="font17"> would be the regional fundamental concepts (essentially related to the determinate region and its synthetical fundamental laws or principles);</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">and we should have as many </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">different groups of categories as there are regions</span><span class="font17"> to differentiate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At the same time </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal ontology</span><span class="font17"> takes its place </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">outwardly</span><span class="font17"> alongside the regional (the proper </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^material/' <sup>Ci</sup>syntheticaV^</span><span class="font17"> ontologies. Its re-&lt;32&gt; gional concept, <sup>^&lt;</sup>object^<sup>,</sup> (cf. §10 above), determines the system of formal axioms and, through them, the set of formal (&quot;analytical&quot;) categories. In this fact there indeed lies a justification for regarding (formal ontology and the material ontologies) as parallel in spite ofall the essential differences which have been emphasized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">At the same time, from here on the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">idea of</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">task</span><span class="font17"> arises: Within the circle of our intuitions ofindividuals, to determine the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">summa genera of concretions</span><span class="font17"> and, in this manner, to effect a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">distribution of all intuited individual being according to regions of being, each of which marks off an eidetic and empirical science</span><span class="font17"> (or group of sciences) that is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessarily distinct</span><span class="font17"> from other sciences because it is distinguished from them on the most radical eidetic grounds. The radical distinction, we may add, in no way excludes an interweaving or a partial overlapping of the sciences. Thus, for example, &quot;material thing&quot; and &quot;psyche&quot; are different regions ofbeing, and yet the latter is founded on the former; and out of that fact arises the fact that psychology is founded on somatology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The problem of a radical <sup>^&lt;</sup>classification^<sup>,</sup> of the sciences is, in the main, the problem of separating regions; and this, in turn, requires antecedent investigations in pure logic like those which were conducted here along some lines. On the other side, to be sure, a phenomenology is also required — of which we still know nothing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">In contrast to matters of fact and the science of matters of fact, the universal statements about essence and the science of essences deal in advance with the essential foundations for our construction of the idea of a pure phenomenology (which, according to the ^Introduction/<sup>5</sup> should develop as a science of essences) as well as for the understanding of its position relative to all empirical sciences and, therefore, relative to psychology in particular. But much depends on all of our essential determinations being understood in the correct sense. In them, let it be sharply emphasized, we were not arguing from pregiven philosophical standpoints; nor did we use traditional philosophical doctrines, not even those which may be universally acknowledged. Instead, we carried out some </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essentially necessary clarifications</span><span class="font17"> in the strictest sense, i.e., we only gave faithful expression to </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">eidetic</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">differences that are directly given to us in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intuition.</span><span class="font17"> We took the differences precisely as they are given in intuition, without any hypothetical or interpretative explication, without reading into them anything which may be suggested to us by traditional theories of ancient or modern times. The findings thus made are actual “beginnings;&quot; and if, like ours, they have a universality related to the comprehensive regions of being, then they are assuredly essentially necessary in the philosophical sense and themselves belong to philosophy. But this latter, too, is something which we need not presuppose; our previous as well as our future considerations should be free from any relation of dependence on a &quot;science&quot; so contested and suspect as philosophy. In our fundamental findings we have presupposed nothing, not even the concept of philosophy, and thus we shall also proceed in the future. Formulated explicitly, the philosophical</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">^noxn<sup>1</sup> that we are undertaking shall consist </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">o\it</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> completely abstaining from any judgment regarding the doctrinal content of any previous philosophy and effecting all of our demonstrations within the limits set by this abstention. </span><span class="font17">On the other hand, therefore, we need not and cannot avoid speaking of philosophy as a historical fact, ofdc </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">facto</span><span class="font17"> philosophical lines of &lt;34&gt; thought which have determined, for good and often for ill, the general scientific convictions of mankind and done so particularly with respect to the basic points treated here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Precisely in this connection we must enter into a controversy with empiricism; but because it involves points that admit of being ascertained immediately, it is a controversy which we can very easily settle while maintaining our </span><span class="font7">玩。％/|. </span><span class="font17">If philosophy has any stock whatever of ''essentially necessary&quot; fundamentals in the genuine sense which, according to their essence, can therefore be grounded only by an immediately presentive intuition, then the controversy concerning them is decided not only independently of any philosophical science, but of the idea of such a science and of the latter's allegedly legitimated theoretical content. The situation forcing the controversy upon us is that &quot;ideas,&quot; &quot;essences,'' <sup>4</sup>&quot;cognition of es-sence,^^ are denied by empiricism. This is not the place to develop the historical reasons why precisely the triumphant advance of the natural sciences — however much, as &quot;mathematical,'' they owe their high scientific level to the laying of eidetic foundations — has favored philosophical empiricism and made it the predominant conviction, indeed, almost the solely dominant one among empirical investigators. In any case, among empirical investigators, and therefore among psychologists, hostility to ideas prevails that eventually must endanger the progress of the experiential sciences themselves because, owing to this hostility, the still uncompleted eidetic founding of these sciences and the perhaps necessary constituting of new eidetic sciences indispensible to their progress have become inhibited. As will be clearly shown later on, what has just been said directly concerns phenomenology which<sup>2</sup> makes up the necessary eidetic foundations of psychology and the cultural sciences. Something must be said, therefore, in defense of our findings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">As we must acknowledge, empiricistic naturalism springs from the most praise worthy motives. In contrast to all &quot;idols,&quot; to the powers of tradition and superstition, of crude and refined prejudices of every sort, it is a radicalism of cognitive practice that aims at enforcing the right of autonomous reason as the sole authority on questions of truth. But to judge rationally or scientifically about things signifies to &lt;35&gt; conform </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">to the things themselves</span><span class="font17"> or to go from words and opinions back to the things themselves, to consult them in their self-givenness and to set aside all prejudices alien to them. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Only another mode of expression</span><span class="font17"> for just this ——</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">so the empiricist believes</span><span class="font17"> —— is that all science must proceed from </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">experience,</span><span class="font17"> must </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ground</span><span class="font17"> its mediate cognition on immediate experience. The empiricist therefore takes genuine science and experiential science to be identical. When contrasted with matters of fact, what are &quot;ideas,&quot; &quot;essences,&quot; but Scholastic entities, metaphysical spectres? To have freed mankind from any such philosophical phantom is held to be the chief merit of modern natural science. All science, it is alleged, only deals with experienceable, real actuality. Whatever is not actuality is imagination; and a science based on imaginings is just an imagined science. Naturally, one will allow imaginings as psychical facts; they belong to psychology. But what we tried to show in the preceding chapter was that by virtue of a so-called eidetic seeing based on imaginings there spring from the imaginings new data, &quot;eidetic&quot; data, objects that are irreal /</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">irrealj. </span><span class="font17">But that, so the empiricist will conclude, is just<sup>4</sup> &quot;ideological excess J a &quot;'reversion to Scholasticism^^ or to those &quot;'speculative constructions a priori&quot; in the first half on the nineteenth century by which an idealism, alienated from natural science, so greatly hampered genuine science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, everything said here by the empiricist is based on misunderstandings and prejudices — no matter how well meant or how good the motive which originally guided him. The essential fault in empiricistic argumentation consists of identifying or confusing the fundamental demand fora return to the &quot;things themselves&quot; with the demand for legitimation of all cognition by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">experience.</span><span class="font17"> With his comprehensible naturalistic constriction of the limits bounding cognizable &quot;things J the empiricist simply takes experience<sup>3</sup> to be the</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">^Insertion in Copy A</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">.- in the customary sense</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">only act that is presentive of things themselves. But </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">things</span><span class="font17"> are not simply mere things belonging to Nature, nor is actuality in the usual sense simply all of actuality; and that originarily presentive act which we<sup>4</sup> call </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">experience relates only to actuality in Nature.</span><span class="font17"> To make identificat-&lt;36&gt; ions here and treat them as supposed truisms is blindly to push aside differences which can be given in the clearest insight. The question therefore is: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Which</span><span class="font17"> side is prejudiced? Genuine freedom from prejudice only demands a rejection of &quot;judgments alien to experience&quot; when the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">proper sense</span><span class="font17"> of the judgments </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">demands</span><span class="font17"> their legitimation by experience. Simply to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">assert</span><span class="font17"> that a</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> judgments admit of, indeed even demand, legitimation by experience without having previously submitted the essence of judgments to a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">study</span><span class="font17"> with respect their fundamentally different species and without having, in so doing, considered whether that assertion is not ultimately </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">countersensical:</span><span class="font17"> that is a ''speculative construction a priori&quot; made no better by the fact that it happens to issue from the empiricistic camp. Genuine science and its own genuine freedom from prejudice require, as the foundation of all proofs, immediately valid judgments which derive their validity from </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originally presentive intuitions.</span><span class="font17"> The latter, however, are of such a character as prescribed by the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sense</span><span class="font17"> of the judgments, or correlatively by the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">proper essence of the predicatively formed judgment-complex.</span><span class="font17"> The fundamental regions of object and, correlatively, the regional types of presentive intuitions, the relevant types ofjudgments, and finally the noetic norms that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">demand</span><span class="font17"> for the establishment ofjudgments belonging to a particular type just this and no other species of intuition: none of that can be postulated or decreed from on high. One can only ascertain them by insight; and, as before, that signifies disclosing them by originally presentive intuition and fixing them by judgments which are faithfully fitted to what is given in such intuition. It seems to us that that is how the procedure actually free from prejudice, or purely objective, would look.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">apprehension purely on the basis of the seeing and within the limits of what is actually seized upon in seeing, if we then see (this being a new mode of &quot;seeing&quot;) how the object is, the faithful expressive statement has, as a consequence, its legitimacy. Not to assign any value to &quot;I see it&quot; as an answer to the question, <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>Why?<sup>M</sup> would be a countersense — as, yet again, we see. Moreover, as may be added here to prevent possible misinterpretations, that does not exclude the possibility that, &lt;37&gt; under some circumstances, one seeing conflicts with another and likewise that one </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">legitimate</span><span class="font17"> assertion conflicts with another. For that, perhaps, no more implies that seeing is not a legitimizing basis than the outweighing ofone force by another signifies that the outweighed force is not a force. It does say, however, that perhaps in a certain category of intuitions (and that is the case precisely with sensuously experiencing intuitions) seeing is, according to its essence, ^imperfect/<sup>5</sup> that ofessential necessity it can become strengthened orweaken-ed, that consequently an assertion having an immediate, and therefore genuine, legitimizing ground in experience nevertheless may have to be abandoned in the further course of experience because of a counter legitimacy outweighing and annulling it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">For experience we therefore substitute something more universal: &quot;intuition;&quot; and by so doing we reject the identification of science taken universally with experiential science. Furthermore, it is easily recognized that by defending this identification, and by contesting the validity of purely eidetic thinking, one arrives at a skepticism which, as genuine skepticism, cancels itself out by a countersense.<sup>7 </sup>We need only ask the empiricist about the source of the validity ofhis universal theses (eg, &quot;AH valid thinking is based upon experience as the only presentive intuition&quot;), and he becomes involved in a demonstrable countersense. After all, direct experience only presents particular singularities and no universalities; therefore it is insufficient. He cannot appeal to eidetic insight because he denies it</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> but surely he can then appeal to induction and thus generally to the whole complex of modes of mediate inference by which experiential</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">science acquires its universal propositions. Now, we ask, what about the truth of mediate inferences, regardless of whether or not they are deductive or inductive? Is this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">truths</span><span class="font17"> (indeed, we could ask, is even the truth of a singular judgment) itself something experienceable and hence ultimately perceivable? And what about those </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">principles</span><span class="font17"> of the modes ofinference to which one appeals in the case of controversy or doubt? For example, what about the syllogistic principles, the principle &quot;that two things, each of which is equal to a third thing, are equal,” etc., to which, as ultimate sources, the justification of all modes ofinference in such cases leads back? Are they themselves also empirical universalizations, or is it not the case that such a conception implies a most radical countersense?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;38&gt; Without entering here into more lengthy analyses, in which we would only repeat what has been said elsewhere,<sup>9</sup> we may have made it at least apparent that the fundamental theses of empiricism need a more precise analysis, clarification and grounding; and that this grounding itself must square with the norms that the theses state. At the same time, however, there manifestly exists here at least a serious suspicion that a countersense is hidden in this relation to something antecedent ——yet hardly the beginning of a serious attempt to produce actual clarity and a scientific grounding of the fundamental theses can be found in the literature ofempiricism. Here, as everywhere else, a scientific, empirical grounding would require that we start from single cases strictly fixed in the manner befitting to theory, and proceed to universal theses employing a method illuminated by eidetic insight. The empiricists have apparently failed to see that the very scientific demands that they, in their theses, present to all cognitions are also addressed to those theses themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As genuine standpoint-philosophers, and in obvious contradistintion to their principle of freedom from prejudice, the empiricists start from unclarified preconceived opinions whose truth has not been grounded. On the other hand, we take our start from what </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">lies prior to </span><span class="font17">all standpoints: from the total realm of whatever is itself given intuitionally and prior to all theorizing, from everything that one can immediately see and seize upon — if only one does not let himself be blinded by prejudices and prevented from taking into consideration</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">We answer: Certainly essences are “concepts&quot; — if by concepts one understands, in so far as that ambiguous word allows, precisely essences. Only let one make clear to himself that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font17"> it is nonsense to talk about them as psychical products and likewise as concept</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formations,</span><span class="font17"> provided the latter is to be understood strictly and properly.<sup>18</sup> One occasionally reads in a treatise that the series of cardinal numbers is a series of concepts and then, a little further on, that &lt;42&gt; concepts are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">products</span><span class="font17"> of thinking. At first cardinal numbers themselves, the essences, were thus designated as concepts. But are not cardinal numbers, we ask, what they are regardless of whether we “form&quot; or do not form them? Certainly, I frame / </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">vollziehe</span><span class="font17"> / my numbers, form my numerical objectivations in adding &quot;one plus one.'&quot;9 These numerical objectivations are now these and when I then form them a second time in an identical way, they are different. In this sense, at one time there are no numerical objectivations of one and the same number, at another time there are many, as many numerical objectivations as we please of one and the same number. Butjust with that we have made (and how can we avoid making) the distinction; the numerical objectivation is not the number itself, it is not the number two, this single member of the numerical series which, like all members, is an atemporal being. To designate it as a psychical formation is thus countersense, an offence against the sense ofarithmetical speech which is perfectly clear, discernible at any time and therefore which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">precedes</span><span class="font17"> all theory.

<p><span class="font17">But, one might object, is it not still true and evident that concepts or, if you will, essences, such as Red, House, etc., arise by abstraction from intuitions of something individual? And do we not at will </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">construct</span><span class="font17"> concepts out of those already formed? Thus we do indeed deal with psychological products. One might even add that it is similar to the case of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">arbitral^ fictions:</span><span class="font17"> The flute-playing centaur we freely imagine is precisely our objectivational formation. — Certainly &quot;concept-fbrmation&quot; and likewise free fiction are carried out spontaneously, and what is spontaneously generated is obviously a product of the mind. But what we arrive at with the flute-playing centaur is objectivation in the sense in which the objectivated is called objectivation, and not the sense in which objectivation is the name of a psychical mental process. Obviously the centaur itself is nothing psychical; it exists neither in the soul nor in consciousness, nor does it exist somewhere else; the centaur is indeed &quot;nothing,&quot; it is wholly &quot;imagination;&quot; stated more precisely: the mental process of imagining is the imagining </span><span class="font7">必 </span><span class="font17">a centaur. To that extent the &quot;supposed-centaur,&quot; the centaur-phantasied, certainly belongs to the mental process itself. But one also should not confuse just this mental process of imagining with what is imagined by it as imagined.<sup>20</sup> As a consequence, in spontaneous abstracting it is also</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">43</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">not the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> which is generated but instead the consciousness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font17"> the essence;<sup>21</sup> and the situation for this is that, and obviously essentially,<sup>22</sup> an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originary presentive</span><span class="font17"> consciousness of an essence (ideation) is in itself and necessarily spontaneous, whereas spontaneity is extraessential to the sensuously presentive, the experiential consciousness: the individual object can &quot;appear,&quot; can be apprehended by consciousness but without a spontaneous &quot;activity” performed &quot;upon” it. Other than those of confusion, there are, accordingly, no discoverable motives which could demand the identification of consciousness of essence with essence itself and which ultimately therefore demand the latter's being psychologized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Nevertheless, the parallel of feigning consciousness might still raise a doubt, namely with respect to the &quot;existence” of essence. Is essence</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">not a fiction as the skeptics would like to have it? Despite that, just as the parallelism of fiction and perception under the more general concept of &quot;intuiting consciousness&quot; prejudices the existence of perceptually given objects, so the parallelism effected above prejudices the &quot;existence&quot; of essence. Things can be perceived and remembered, and therefore there can be consciousness of them as &quot;actual;&quot; or, in modified acts there can be consciousness of things as &quot;doubt-^ul,^^ null (illusory); finally, in entirely different modifications as well, there can be consciousness of things as &quot;simply hovering before us&quot; and hovering before us as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">quasi-actual,</span><span class="font17"> null, etc. The case is wholly similar with essences: like other objects they can at times be intended to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[vermeinQ</span><span class="font17"> correctly, at times falsely, as, e.g., in false geometrical thinking.

<p><span class="font17">Enough now of absurd theories. No conceivable theory can make us err with respect to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">principle of all principles: that every originary presentive intuition is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> legitimizing source of cognition,</span><span class="font17"> that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">everything originarily</span><span class="font17"> (so to speak, in its &quot;personal&quot; actuality) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">offered</span><span class="font17"> to us </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in ^intuition&quot; is to be accepted simply as what it is presented as being,</span><span class="font17"> but also &lt;44&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">only within the limits in which </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> is presented there.</span><span class="font17"> We see indeed that each </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">theory</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">can only again draw its truth itself from orginiary data. Every statement which does no more than confer expression on such data by simple explication and by means of significations precisely conforming to them is, as we said at the beginning of this chapter, actually an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">absolute beginning</span><span class="font17"> called upon to serve as a foundation, a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">principium</span><span class="font17"> in the genuine sense of the word. But this holds especially for this kind of generical cognitions of essences to which the word &quot;principle&quot; is commonly limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this sense the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">scientific investigator of Nature</span><span class="font17"> is perfectly right in following the &quot;principle&quot; that we question every assertion bearing upon matters of fact of Nature relative to the experience which grounds it. Because that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font17"> a principle, it is an assertion in so far as we make perfectly clear the sense of the expressions used in the principle and make given in purity the essences pertaining to the expressions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But in the same sense the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">scientific investigator of essences,</span><span class="font17"> and whoever at any time employs and states generical propositions, must follow a parallel principle; and such a principle must be given because the one just granted, the principle of the grounding of all cognition of matters of fact by experience, is not itself given with insight in experience — as is the case with every principle and every cognition of essence without exception.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§25 . In Praxis: The Positivist as Scientific Investigator of Nature. In Reflection: The Scientific Investigator of Nature as Positivist.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">De facto</span><span class="font17"> the positivist rejects eidetic cognitions only when he reflects &quot;philosophically&quot; and allows himself to be deceived by the sophisms of empiricistic philosophers; but he does not do any of this when, as scientific investigator ofNature, he thinks and grounds his thought in the normal, natural scientific attitude. For there he obviously lets himself be guided to a very wide extent by eidetic insights. It is well known that the basic means of natural scientific theorizing are the purely mathematical disciplines such as the material disciplines of geometry or phoronomy, the formal (purely logical) disciplines such as arithmetic, analysis, etc. It is manifestly clear that these disciplines do not proceed empirically, that they are not grounded by observation and experiments on experienced<sup>23</sup> figures, movements, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Empiricism will certainly not see this. But should one take seriously its argument that far from there being too few grounding </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">45</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">experiences, there are, instead, an infinity of experiences at our command? In the collective experience of all generations of man, even in the generations themselves of animals preceding them, an immense treasure of geometrical and arithmetical impressions have been collected and integrated in the form of interpretational habitu-alities, and from out of this foundation our geometrical insights now are drawn. </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">But from where does one then know of these alleged collective treasures when no one has observed them scientifically and faithfully documented them? Since when are long forgotten and completely hypothetical experiences the grounds of a science — and, in that connection, of the most exact science — instead of actual</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">experiences most carefully demonstrated in their genuine experiential function and range? The physicist observes and experiments and satisfies himself with good grounds, not with prescientific experiences, not to mention instinctive interpretations and hypotheses about alleged hereditary experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Or should one say, as has in fact been said on other sides, that we owe geometrical insights to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>(&lt;</sup>experience in phantasy &quot;<sup>}</sup></span><span class="font17"> that we ought to effect them as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">inductions based upon experiments in phantasy?</span><span class="font17"> But why, we ask </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in contra,</span><span class="font17"> does the psysicist make no use of such marvelous experience in phantasy? For no other reason than because experiments in the imagination are imagined experiments, just as figures, movements, multiplicities in phantasy are not actual but imagined ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, in contrast to all such interpretations, instead of adopting and arguing from their basis, we take the most correct course by referring to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sense proper</span><span class="font17"> of mathematical assertions. In order to know, and to know without doubt, what a mathematical axiom states, we have to turn not to empiricistic philosophers but rather to that consciousness in which, in full insight, we mathematizingly seize upon axiomatic predicatively formed affair-complexes. If we hold ourselves to this intuition in purity, there is no doubt at all that pure essential connections are expressed without the slightest correlative positing of experiential matters of fact.<sup>24</sup> One must not philosophize and psychologize about geometrical thinking and intuiting from outside instead of livingly carrying it out and determining its imma-nental sense on the ground of direct analysis. It may be that we have inherited cognitive dispositions from cognitions of past generations; but in so far as the question about the sense and value of our cognitions is concerned, the histories of these heritages are as indifferent as the history of gold is for the value of our gold.</span></p>

It may also be that mathematics precipitously anticipates eidetic universalities which only allow of being redeemed in a limited way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">method. This is fortunate for them. Natural science has become great by unhestitatingly setting aside the luxuriant growth of ancient skepticism and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">refusing</span><span class="font17"> to conqueror it. In place of slaving over such puzzling seperate questions as how cognition of an &quot;external” Nature is at all possible, or how all the difficulties were to be resolved which the ancients had already found in this possibility, they preferred to busy themselves with the question about the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">right method</span><span class="font17"> of cognition of Nature which can actually be carried out and which is as perfect as possible: cognition in the form of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">exact</span><span class="font17"> natural science. Having this orientation by which it acquired a free avenue for its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">material</span><span class="font17"> research, natural science, however, has taken </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">half a step backwards again</span><span class="font17"> whereby </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">it has given room to new skeptical reflections and let itself be limited by skeptical tendencies in its possibilitiesfor work.</span><span class="font17"> As a result of being abandoned to empiricistic prejudices, skepticism now remains put out of action only with respect to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sphere of experience,</span><span class="font17"> but no longer with respect to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sphere of essence,</span><span class="font17"> This is because it is not sufficient to draw the eidetic into its circle of research under false empiricistic colors. Such transformations of value are tolerated only by eidetic disciplines, like the mathematical ones which are grounded in antiquity and protected by the rights of custom; whereas (as we have already indicated) the empiricistic prejudices must function with respect to the grounding of newer disciplines as completely effective obstacles. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">right position, dogmatic</span><span class="font17"> in a good sense, that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">i^prephilosophical, sphere of research</span><span class="font17"> in which all experiential sciences belong (but not only those sciences) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is that position which sets aside with full awareness all skepticism together with all<sup>(&lt;</sup> natural philosophy&quot; and <sup>cs</sup>theory of knowledge/<sup>9</sup></span><span class="font17"> and takes cognitive objectivities where one actually finds them — no matter what difficulties an epistemological reflection on the possibility of such objectivities may always point out </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Just here there is an unavoidable and important division to be made in the realm of scientific research. On the one side stand </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sciences of the dogmatic attitude</span><span class="font17"> turned toward things, unconcerned with epistemological or skeptical problems. They start out from the origi- &lt;47&gt; nary givenness of their things (and always again return to it in the demonstration of their cognitions); and they ask: As what are the things immediately given, and on that basis, what can be mediately concluded about these things and about any things whatever of the domain? On the other side stands scientific research peculiar to the epistemological, to the specifically philosophical attitude which pur-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">48 </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO PURE PHENOMENOLOGY </span><span class="font17">sues the skeptical problems of the possibility of knowledge which are directly resolved into the universality of principles so that, by applying the solutions acquired, the consequences forjudging about the ultimate sense and cognitive value of the results of the dogmatic sciences can be drawn. In the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">present situation,</span><span class="font17"> and as long as there is indeed lacking a highly developed cognitive critique which succeeds in perfect rigor and clarity, it is at the least </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">right to close the boundaries of dogmatic research to <sup>iC</sup>critic^ modes of inquiry.</span><span class="font17"> In other words, at the moment it appears right to us to take care that epistemological (and, as a rule, skeptical) prejudices — the correctness and incorrectness of which philosophical science has to decide, but which need not concern the dogmatic investigator — are not obstacles to the course of the dogmatic investigator's inquiries. But it is precisely the way of skepticisms that they are susceptible of unfavorable obstacles of that kind.</span></p>

No matter how satisfied cognition might be which is purely materially directed and borne by insight, as soon as it reflectively turns back upon itself the possibility of validity of all modes of cognition and, under that, even of intuitions and insights, is infected by confusing unclarities, by sheer, unresolvable difficulties; and this is especially the case with respect to the transcendence which cognitive </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Objects</span><span class="font17"> claim over against cognition.

<p><span class="font17">We begin our considerations as human beings who are living naturally, objectivating, judging, feeling, willing </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>((</sup>in the natural attitude.&quot; </span><span class="font17">What that signifies we shall make clear in simple meditations which can best be carried out in the first person singular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I am conscious of a world endlessly spread out in space, endlessly becoming and having endlessly become in time. I am conscious of it: that signifies, above all, that intuitively I find it immediately,<sup>1</sup> that I experience it.<sup>2</sup> By my seeing, touching, hearing, and so forth, and in the different modes of sensuous perception, corporeal physical things with some spatial distribution or other are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">simply therefor me, ^on hand&quot; </span><span class="font17">in the literal or the figurative sense, whether or not I am particularly heedful of them and busied with them in my considering, thinking, feeling, or willing. Animate beings too — human beings, let us say — are immediately there for me: I look up; I see them; I hear their approach; I grasp their hands; talking with them I understand immediately what they objectivate and think, what feelings stir within them, what they wish or will. They are also present as actualities in my field of intuition even when I do not heed them. But it is not necessary that they, and likewise that other objects, be found directly in my </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">field of perception^</span><span class="font17"> Along with the ones now perceived, other actual objects are there for me as determinate, as more or less well known, without being themselves perceived or, indeed, present </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">49</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">in any other mode of intuition.

On the contrary, in the fixed order of its being, it reaches into the unlimited. What is now perceived and what is more or less clearly co-present and determinate<sup>6</sup> (or at least somewhat determinate), are penetrated and surrounded by an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">obscurely intended to horizon of indeterminate actuality.</span><span class="font17"> I can send rays of the illuminative regard of attention into this horizon with varying results. Determining presentiations, obscure at first and then becoming alive, haul something out for me; a chain of such quasi-memories is linked together</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> the sphere of determinateness becomes wider and wider, perhaps so wide that connection is made with the field of actual perception as my </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">central</span><span class="font17"> surroundings. But generally the result is different: an empty mist of obscure indeterminateness is populated with intuited possibilities or likelihoods; and only the <sup>t&lt;</sup>^b^m<sup>,</sup>^ of the world, precisely as &quot;the world,&quot; is predelineated. Moreover, my indeterminate surroundings are infinite, the<sup>7</sup> misty and never fully determinable horizon is necessarily there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What is the case with the world as existing in the order of the spatial present, which I have just been tracing, is also the case with respect to its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">order in the sequence of time.</span><span class="font17"> This world, on hand for me now and manifestly in every waking Now, has its two-sidedly infinite temporal horizon, its known and unknown, immediately living and lifeless past and future.

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§31 . Radical Alteration of the Natural Positing. <sup>cc</sup>Excluding,&quot;<sup>3 </sup>^Parenthesizingy</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Instead of remaining in this attitude, we propose to alter it radically.</span><span class="font17"> What we now must do is to convince ourselves of the essential possibility of the alteration in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The general positing, by virtue of which there is not just any continual apprehensional consciousness of the real surrounding world, but a consciousness of it as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">factually existing</span><span class="font17"> &quot;actuality,” naturally does </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not consist of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> particular act,</span><span class="font17"> perchance an articulated<sup>22</sup>judgment </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">about</span><span class="font17"> existence. It is, after all, something that lasts continuously throughout the whole duration of the attitude, i.e., throughout natural waking life. That which at any time is perceived, is clearly or obscurely presentiated — in short, everything which is, before any thinking, an object of experiential consciousness issuing, from the natural world — bears, in its total unity and with respect to all articulated saliencies in it, the characteristic &quot;there J &quot;on hand;''</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">and it is essentially possible to base on this characteristic an explicit (predicative) judgment of existence agreeing with it. Ifwe state such a judgment, we nevertheless know that in it we have only made thematic and conceived as a predicate what already was somehow inherent, as unthematic, unthought, unpredicated, in the original experiencing or, correlatively, in the experienced, as the characteristic of something “on hand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We can now proceed with the potential and inexplicit positing precisely as we can with the explicit judgment-positing. One procedure, possible at any time, is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">attempt to doubt universally</span><span class="font17"> which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Descartes</span><span class="font17"> carried out for an entirely different purpose with a view toward bringing out a sphere of absolutely indubitable being. We &lt;54&gt; start from here, but at the same time emphasize that the attempt to doubt universally shall serve us only as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">methodic expedient</span><span class="font17"> for picking out certain points which, as included in its essence, can be brought to light and made evident by means of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The attempt to doubt universally belongs to the realm of our </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">perfect Jreedom:</span><span class="font17"> we can </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">attempt to doubt</span><span class="font17"> anything whatever, no matter how firmly convinced of it, even assured of it in an adequate evidence, we may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Let us reflect on what lies in the essence of such an act.</span><span class="font17"> Someone who attempts to doubt some “being'' or other, or predicatively explicated, a “that exists,” a “that is how it is,&quot; or the like. The sort of being does not matter. For example, someone who doubts whether an object, the being of which he does not doubt, is qualified thus and so, doubts precisely the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being-qualified-thus-and-so.</span><span class="font17"> Obviously this is carried over from doubting to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">attempting</span><span class="font17"> to doubt. Furthermore, it is clear that we cannot doubt a being and, in the same consciousness (with the form of unity belonging to the simultaneous) posit the substrate of this being, thus being conscious of the substrate as having the characteristic, &quot;on hand.” Equivalently expressed: The same material of being cannot be simultaneously doubted and held to be certain. In like manner, it is clear that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">attempt</span><span class="font17"> to doubt anything intended to as something </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">on hand</span><span class="font17"> necessarily </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">effects a certain annulment of positing</span><span class="font17"> and precisely this interests us. The annulment in question is not a transmutation of positing into counter positing, of position into negation; it is also not a transmutation into uncertain presumption, deeming possible, undecidedness, into a doubt (in any sense whatever of the word): nor indeed is anything like that within the sphere of our free choice. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Rather it is something wholly peculiar. We do not give up the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positing we effected, we do not in any respect alter our conviction</span><span class="font17"> which remains in itself as it is as long as we do not introduce newjudgment-motives: precisely this is what we do not do. Nevertheless the positing undergoes a modification: while it in itself remains what it is, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">we, so to speak, ''put it</span><span class="font17"> o</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">£ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of action<sup>,,,</sup> we &quot;exclude </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">,&quot; we<sup>iC</sup>parenthesize</span><span class="font17"> &quot;&quot;.It is still there, like the parenthesized in the parentheses, like the excluded outside the context of inclusion </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[wie das Ausgeschaltete aufierhalb des ^usammenhanges der Schaltung]</span><span class="font17">. We can also say: The positing is a mental process, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">but we make <sup>iC</sup>no use<sup>3 3</sup> of it,</span><span class="font17"> and this is not understood, naturally, as implying that we are deprived of it (as it would if we said of someone who was not conscious, that he made no &lt;55&gt; use of a positing); rather, in the case of this expression and all parallel expressions it is a matter of indicative designations of a definite, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">specifically peculiar mode of consciousness</span><span class="font17"> which is added to the original positing simpliciter<sup>23</sup> (whether this is or not an actional </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[aktuelle]</span><span class="font17"> and even a predicative </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positing</span><span class="font17"> of existence) and, likewise in a specifically peculiar manner, changes its value. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">This changing &quot;value is a matter in which we are perfectlyfree, and it stands over against all cogitative position-takings</span><span class="font17"> coordinate with the positing and incompatible with the positing in the unity of the &quot;simultaneous,'' as well as over against all position-takings in the proper sense of the term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the attempt to doubt which accompanies a positing which, as we presuppose, is certain and continued, the &quot;excluding&quot; is brought about in and with a modification of the counter positing, namely the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;supposition<sup>3 3</sup>&quot; non-being</span><span class="font17"> which is, therefore, part of the substratum of the attempt to doubt. In Descartes this part is so predominant that one can say that his attempt to doubt universally is properly an attempt to negate universally. Here we disregard this part; we are not interested in every analytically distinguishable component of the attempt to doubt, and consequently we are not interested in the exact and fully sufficient analysis of it. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">We single out only the phenomenon</span><span class="font17"> of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>i(</sup> parenthesizing<sup>3 3</sup> or&quot; excluding&quot;</span><span class="font17"> which, while obviously not restricted to the phenomenon of attempting to doubt, is particularly easy to analyze out and which can, on the contrary, make its appearance </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">also in other combinations</span><span class="font17"> and, equally well, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">alone.</span><span class="font17"> With regard to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any </span><span class="font17">positing we can quite freely exercise this pecuH^r </span><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">^roxh,</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">certain ref raining from judgment which is compatible with the unshaken conviction of</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Naturally one must not identify this consciousness with the consciousness called &quot;mere phantasying,^^ let us say, that nymphs are performing a round dance. In the latter consciousness, after all, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">no excluding</span><span class="font17"> of a living conviction, which remains alive,<sup>25</sup> takes place. The consciousness of which we are speaking is even further from being a matter ofjust thinking of something in the sense </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of<sup>C(</sup> assuming<sup>3 3 </sup></span><span class="font17">or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">presupposing^</span><span class="font17"> which, in ordinary equivocal language, can also be expressed by &quot;It seems to me (I make the assumption) that such and &lt;56&gt; such is the case.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It should also be said that nothing prevents </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">speaking correlativefy cf parenthesizing</span><span class="font17"> with respect to a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positabl^ objectivity</span><span class="font17"> belonging to no matter what region and category. When speaking thus, we mean that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">every positing^<sup>1</sup> related to this objectivity is to be excluded</span><span class="font17"> and converted into its parenthetical modification. Furthermore, when the metaphor of parenthesizing is closely examined it is seen to be, from the very beginning, more suitable to the object-sphere; just as the locution of &quot;putting out of action^^ is better suited to the act- or consciousnesssphere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">We could now let the universal §noxn, in our sharply determinate and novel sense of the term, take the place of the Cartesian attempt to doubt universally.

<p><span class="font17">province arises by virtue of the new attitude.<sup>13</sup> As a consequence, it follows that instead of keeping our regard turned toward those<sup>14 </sup>spheres, we turned it away from them and sought the new Objects in the ontological realms of arithmetic, geometry, and the like — where, after all, nothing genuinely new could be attained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We shall therefore keep our regard fixed upon the sphere of &lt;59&gt; consciousness<sup>15</sup> and study what we find immanently within </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">it.</span><span class="font17"> First of all, without as yet effecting the phenomenological judgmentexclusions, we shall subject it to a systematic, though by no means exhaustive, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic</span><span class="font17"> analysis. What we absolutely need is a certain unversal insight into<sup>16</sup> the essence </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">o(any consciousness whatever</span><span class="font17"> and also, quite particularly, of consciousness in so far as it is, in itself by its essence consciousness of &quot;natural&quot; actuality. In these studies we shall go as far as is necessary to effect the insight at which we are aiming, namely the insight<sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">that consciousness has, in itself, a being &quot;its own which in its own absolute essence, is not touched by the phenomenological exclusion.</span><span class="font17"> It therefore remains as the '</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;phenomenological residuum^</span><span class="font17"> as a region of being which is of essential necessity quite unique and which can</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">indeed become the field of a science of a novel kind: phenomenology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The &quot;phenomenological&quot;</span><span class="font7">加</span><span class="font17">o%f| will deserve its name only by means of this insight; the fully conscious effecting of that </span><span class="font7">加。讲 </span><span class="font17">will prove itself to be the operation necessary to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">make</span><span class="font7"> '争〃</span><span class="font11">，</span><span class="font17">e'' </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consciousness<sub>t </sub>and subsequently the whole phenomenological region ^ accessible</span><span class="font17"> £o </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">s. Precisely that makes it comprehensible why this region and the<sup>18</sup> novel science correlated with it remained necessarily unknown: In the natural attitude nothing else but the natural world is seen. As long as the possibility of the phenomenological attitude had not been recognized, and the method for bringing about an originary seizing upon the objectivities that arise with that attitude had not been developed, the phenomenological world<sup>19</sup> had to remain unknown, indeed, hardly even suspected.<sup>20</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Concerning our terminology we may add the following. Important motives, grounded in the<sup>21</sup> epistemological problematic, justify our designating &quot;pure&quot; consciousness, about which we shall have so much to say, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as transcendental consciousness</span><span class="font17"> and the operation by which it is reached the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">transcendental</span><span class="font17"> Mo%h As a method this operation<sup>22</sup>will be divided into different steps of &quot;excluding,&quot; &quot;parenthesizing;&quot; and thus our method will assume the characteristic of a step-by-step reduction.

Within the mental process of perceiving this sheet of white paper, more precisely, within those components of the perceiving which relate to the quality, whiteness, belonging to the sheet of paper, we find, by a suitable turning of regard,<sup>92</sup> the Datum of sensation, white. This white<sup>93</sup> is something which belongs inseparably to the essence of the concrete perception, and belongs to it as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">really inherent</span><span class="font17"> concrete component.

<p><span class="font17">Without being able to go more deeply here into a descriptive<sup>94</sup> eidetic analysis of intentive mental processes, we shall bring out some moments which should be heeded in the interest of further exposition. If an intentive mental process is actional, that is, effected in the manner of the cogito, then in that process the subject<sup>95</sup> is &quot;directing&quot; himself to the intentional Object. To the cogito itself there belongs, as immanent in it, a &quot;regard</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17">to'' the Object which, on the other side,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">wells forth from the &quot;Ego'' which therefore can never be lacking. This Ego-regard to something varies with the act: in perception, it is a perceptual regard-to</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> in phantasying, an inventive regard-to</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> in liking, a liking regard-to; in willing, a willing regard-to</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> etc. This signifies that this having the mind's eye on something, which pertains to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of the cogito, of the act as act,<sup>96</sup> is not itself in turn, an act in its own right and especially must not be confused with a perceiving </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">66</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">(no matter how broad a sense) nor with any sorts of act akin to perceptions. It should be noted that<sup>97</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intentional</span><span class="font17"> Object of a consciousness (taken in the manner in which the intentional Object is the full correlate of a consciousness), by no means signifies the same as Object </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">seized upon.</span><span class="font17"> We are accustomed simply to include being seized upon in our concept of the Object (any object whatever)<sup>98 </sup>because, as soon as we think / the Object, as soon as we say something </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">about</span><span class="font17"> it, we have made it the object in the sense of what is seized upon. The seizing-upon in the broadest sense is equivalent to noticing it, whether in being especially attentive or in heeding it incidentally: at least as these locutions are usually understood. Now </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">this heeding or seizing-upon is not </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> matter of the mode of any cogito whatever^ </span><span class="font17">the mode of actionality; seen more precisely, it is instead a particular </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">act-mode</span><span class="font17"> which can be taken on by any consciousness, or any act, which does not already have it. Ifthat occurs, its intentional Object is not just any object whatever of consciousness and in view as something to which the mental regard is directed; it is rather an Object seized upon, heeded. To a physical thing, to be sure, we cannot be turned otherwise than in the manner of seizing upon; and so for all </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">objectivities which can be ^objectivatedsimply:&quot;</span><span class="font17"> advertence (even ifit be in phantasying) is eo ipso &quot;seizing upon,&quot; &quot;heeding.&quot; However, in the act of valuing, we are turned to the valued; in the act of gladness, to the gladsome; in the act of loving, to the loved</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> in the acting to the action; but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">without</span><span class="font17"> seizing upon any of them.

<p><span class="font17">We add the following:<sup>109</sup> When living in the cogito we are not<sup>101 </sup>conscious of the cogitatio itself as an intentional Object; but at any time it can become an Object ofconsciousness; its essence involves the essential possibility of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reflective turning of regard</span><span class="font17"> and naturally in the form of a new cogitatio that, in the manner proper to a cogitatio which simply seizes upon,<sup>111</sup> is directed to it. In other words, any &lt;cogatio&gt; can become the object of a so-called ''internal percept ion<sup>,5 </sup>and in further succession the Object of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reflective</span><span class="font17"> valuation, an approval or a disapproval, etc. The same holds in a correspondingly </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">68</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">modified way not only for actual<sup>112</sup> acts in the sense of act-</span></p>

For example: we have not only natural processes but also actions, alterations in the works of the mind, in cultural Objects of every sort and as cultural Objects (eg, loss of value in works of art because of &quot;spoiling,” machines becoming useless), and complexes of literary works, not as mere physical things belonging to Nature but as chapters in a book or as the complex of works making up a national literature, relative to authors, readers, nations, etc. With respect to the manners of givenness, we then find not merely ph\ sical &quot;horizons” as horizons of a possible experience of Nature, but also \ alue-horizons and practical horizons; fbr example, the practical horizon which the doer has at all limes in his purposefully active doing relative to the unity of a goal which itself stands in mere exU'iisivc concaienations of ends. In addition, however, there are essentially possible differences in attitude (always within the total frame of the natural attitude) such that all Objectivities, no matter how highly founded, for instance, those arising from the originally valuing attitude, or from the originally practical attitude, can be taken over into the &quot;theoretical” attitude of seizing-upon and can therefore become the themes of either a transitory or a consistently maintained &quot;objectivating:&quot; in particular, an experiencing, explicating, predicating, etc.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">moment, from its Object. If that which is being perceived is an intentive mental process, as it is when we are reflecting on a conviction which is alivejust now (perhaps stating: I am convinced that...), we have an interpenetration of two intentive mental processes, at least the higher of which is non-selfsufficient and at the same time not &lt;69&gt; only founded on the lower but also intentively turned to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This sort of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">really inherent &quot;includedness”</span><span class="font17"> (strictly speaking, a metaphor) is a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pre-eminent characteristic of the perception &quot;something immanent and of the position-taking founded on such perception;</span><span class="font17"> it is lacking in most other cases<sup>120</sup> of relation to something immanent on the part of intentive mental processes.<sup>121</sup> Thus, for example, it is lacking even in the case of rememberings of rememberings. The remembered remembering that occurred yesterday does not belong to the present remembering as a really inherent component of its concrete unity. With respect to its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">own</span><span class="font17"> full full essence, the present remembering could exist even though in truth the past remembering had never existed; whereas the past remembering, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font17"> it actually did exist, belongs necessarily with the present remembering, to the one identical and uninterrupted stream which continuously mediates the two by various concretions of mental processes. In this respect, the situation is obviously quite different in the case of perceptions of something transcendent and other intentive mental processes relating to something transcendent. Not only does the perception of the physical thing not contain the physical thing itself as part ofits really inherent composition; the perception of the physical thing is also </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">without any<sup>122, </sup>essential unity with it,</span><span class="font17"> its existence, naturally, being presupposed here. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The unity of the stream of mental processes is the only unity determined purely by </span><span class="font7">於</span><span class="font17">©123 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essences proper of the mental processes themselves}</span><span class="font17"> or, this being the same thing, a mental process can be combined </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font17"> with mental processes to make up a whole the total essence ofwhich embraces and is founded on the<sup>124</sup> essences proper of these mental processes.

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Now,</span><span class="font17"> all of that being presupposed, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">what is included in the concrete, really inherent composition of perception itself, as the cogitatio?</span><span class="font17"> Obviously not the physical thing as determined by physics, that utterly transcendent thing— transcendent<sup>161</sup> to the whole &quot;world ofappearance.<sup>55</sup> But not </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">even the latter,</span><span class="font17"> although it is called &quot;merely subjective,<sup>55</sup> with all the particular physical things and occurrences belonging to it, is excluded from the really inherent composition of perception; it is ^transcendent<sup>55</sup> to perception. Let us consider this more closely. We have already spoken,<sup>162</sup> though only in passing, of the transcendence of the physical thing.<sup>163</sup> We now must acquire a deeper insight into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">how the transcendent stands with respect to the consciousness which is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> consciousness of it,</span><span class="font17"> into how this mutual relationship, which has its paradoxes, should be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us therefore exclude the whole of physics and the whole domain of theoretical thinking. Let us remain within the limits of simple intuition and the syntheses belonging to it, among which perception is included. It is evident then that intuition and intuited, perception and perceived physcial thing are, more particularly, essentially interrelated but, as a matter of essential necessity, are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not really inherently and essentially one and combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us start with an example. Constantly seeing this table and meanwhile walking around it, changing my position in space in whatever way, I have continually the consciousness of this one </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">74</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">identical table as factually existing &quot;in person<sup>55</sup> and remaining quite unchanged. The table-perception, however, is a continually changing one; it is a continuity of changing perceptions. I close my eyes. My other senses have no relation to the table. Now I have no perception ofit. I open my eyes; and I have the perception again. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font17">perception? Let us be more precise. Returning, it is not, under any circumstances, individually the same. Only the table is the same, intended to as the same in the synthetical consciousness which connects the new perception with the memory. The perceived phys-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">ical thing can exist without being perceived, without even being potentially intended to (in the already described<sup>164</sup> mode of non-actionality); and it can exist without changing. The perception itself however, is what it is in the continuous flux of consciousness and is itself a continuous flux: continually the perceptual Now changes into the enduring consciousness of the J ust-Past and simultaneously a new Now lights up, etc. Like the perceived thing as a whole, whatever parts, sides, moments accrue to it necessarily, and always for the same reasons, transcends the perception regardless of whether the particular property be called a primary or a secondary quality. The color of the seen physical thing is, of essential necessity, not a really inherent moment of the consciousness of color; it appears, but while it is appearing the appearance can and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">must,</span><span class="font17"> in the case of a legitimating experience, be continually changing. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The same</span><span class="font17"> color appears &quot;in&quot; continuous multiplicities of color </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">adumbrations.</span><span class="font17"> Something similar is true of every sensuous quality and also of every spatial shape.

The application to cases involving changes of any kind is obvious.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Our considerations have established that the physical thing<sup>172</sup> is transcendent to the perception of it and consequently to any consciousness whatever related to it; it is transcendent not merely in the sense that the physical thing cannot be found infactasa really inherent component of consciousness; rather the whole situation is an object of eidetic insight: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">With an absolutely unconditional</span><span class="font17"> universality and necessity it is the case that a physical thing cannot be given in any possible perception, in any possible consciousness, as something really inherently immanent. Thus there emerges a fundamentally essential difference between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being as mental process and being as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> physical thing.</span><span class="font17"> Of essential necessity it belongs to the regional essence, Mental Process<sup>173</sup> (specifically to the regional particularization, Cogitatio) that it can be perceived in an immanental perception; fundamentally and necessarily it belongs to the essence of a spatial physical thing that it cannot be so perceived. I£ as we learn from a deeper analysis, it is of the essence of any intuition presentive of a physical thing that, along with the physical-thing datum, other data analogous to physical things can be seized upon in a corresponding turn of the regard in the manner, let us say, of detachable strata and lower levels in the constitution of the appearing physical thing — e.g., </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">“sight thing&quot; </span><span class="font17">with its difl'erent particularizations ——still precisely the same is true of them: They are of essential necessity transcendencies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">something transcedent somewhat further, let us introduce the following remark. Disregarding perception, we find intentive mental processes of many kinds that, by virtue of their essence, exclude the really inherent immanence of their intentional objects no matter what the objects may otherwise be.<sup>174</sup> That holds, for example, of any pre-sentiation: of any memory, of the empathic seizing upon someone else^ consciousness, etc. Naturally we must not confuse this tran- &lt;77 scendence with the transcendence with which we are concerned here. To the physical thing as physical thing, to any reality in the genuine sense, the sense of which we have yet to clarify and fix, there belongs essentially and quite &quot;universally''i75 the incapacity of being immanently perceived and accordingly of being found at all in the concatenation of mental processes. Thus the physical thing is said to be, in itself unqualifiedly transcendent. Precisely in that the essentially necessary diversity among modes of being, the most cardinal of them all, becomes manifest: the diversity between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consciousness and reality.<sup>176</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Our exposition has brought out the further fact that this contrast between something immanent and something transcendent includes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">an essentially fundamental difference between the corresponding kinds of givenness.</span><span class="font17"> Perception ofsomething immanent and of something transcendent do not differ merely in that the intentional object, which is there with the characteristic of something it itself &quot;in person/<sup>5</sup> is really inherently immanent in the perceiving in one case but not in the other: rather they are differentiated by modes of givenness the essential difference between which is carried over mutatis mutandis into all the presentiational modifications of perception, into the parallel memorial intuitions and phantasy intuitions. We perceive the physical thing by virtue of its being &quot;adumbrated&quot; in respect of all the determinations which, in a given case, “actually&quot; and properly &quot;fkll within the scope o</span><span class="font7">「' </span><span class="font17">perception. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">A mental process is not adumbrated,<sup>111</sup></span><span class="font17"> It is neither an accident of the own peculiar sense of the physical thing nor a contingency of &quot;our human constitution/<sup>5</sup> that</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;our” perception can arrive at physical things themselves only through mere adumbrations<sup>178</sup> of them. Rather is it evident and drawn from the essence of spatial physical things (even in the widest sense, which includes &quot;sight things”</span><span class="font11">)</span><span class="font17">that, necessarily a being of that kind can be given in perception only through an<sup>179</sup> adumbration; and in like manner it is evident from the essence ofcogitationes, from the essence of mental processes of any kind, that they exclude anything like that. For an existent belonging to their region, in other words, anything like an &quot;appearingJ a being presented, through<sup>180 </sup>adumbrations makes no sense whatever. Where there is no spatial being it is senseless to speak of a seeing from different standpoints with a changing orientation in accordance with different perappea-rances,<sup>181</sup> adumbrations. On the other hand,<sup>182</sup> it is an essential necessity, to be seized upon as essential in apodictic insight, that any spatial being whatever is perceivable for an Ego (for any possible Ego) only with the kind of givenness designated. A spatial being<sup>183</sup></span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">78</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">can &quot;appear” only in a certain ^orientation/<sup>5</sup> which necessarily predelineates a system of possible new orientations each of which, in turn, corresponds to a certain &quot;mode of appearance<sup>?,</sup> which we can express, say, as givenness from such and such a &quot;side J and so forth. If we understand modes of appearance in the sense of modes of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mental processes</span><span class="font17"> (the phrase can also have a corresponding ontic sense, as is evident from the description just offered), then this signifies: It is essential to certain </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sorts ^ mental processes</span><span class="font17"> which have a peculiar structure, more precisely, it belongs to certain concrete perceptions which have a peculiar structure,<sup>184</sup> that what is intended to in them is meant as a spatial physical thing; to their essence belongs the ideal possibility of their changing into determinately ordered<sup>185</sup> continuous multiplicities of perception which can always be continued, thus which are never completed. It is then inherent in the essential structure of those multiplicities that they bring about the unity of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">harmoniously presentive</span><span class="font17"> consciousness and, more particularly, of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">It is therefore fundamentally erroneous to believe that perception (and, after its own fashion, any other kind of intuition of a physical thing) does not reach the physical thing itself The latter is not given to us in itselfor in its being-in-itself. There belongs to any existent the essential possibility of being simply intuited as what it is and, more particularly, of being perceived as what it is in an adequate perception, one that is presentive of that existent itself &quot;in person,&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">without any mediation by ^appearances &quot;'</span><span class="font17"> God, the subject possessing an absolutely perfect knowledge and therefore possessing every possible adequate perception, naturally has that adequate perception of the very physical thing itself which is denied to us finite beings.</span></p>

Everything which we have worked out about the givenness of the physical thing loses its sense here, and one must make that fully clear to oneself in detail. A mental process of feeling is not adumbrated.<sup>200 </sup>If I look at it, I have<sup>201</sup> something absolute; it has no sides that could be presented sometimes in one mode and sometimes in another.<sup>202</sup> I can think something true or something false about a feeling, but what I see when I look at it is there, with its qualities, its intensity, etc., absolutely.<sup>203</sup> A violin tone, in contrast, with its objective identity, is given by adumbration, has its changing modes of appearance. These differ in accordance with whether I approach the violin or go farther away from it, in accordance with whether I am in the concert hall itself or am listening through the closed doors, etc. No one mode of appearance can claim to be the one that presents the tone absolutely although, in accordance with my practical interests, a certain appearance has a certain primacy as the normal appearance: in the &lt;82) concert hall and at the &quot;right&quot; spot I hear the tone ''itself<sup>5</sup> as it <sup>t&lt;</sup>actually<sup>,)</sup> sounds. In the same way we say that any physical thing in relation to vision has a normal appearance; we say of the color, the shape, the whole physical thing which we see in normal daylight and in a normal orientation relative to us, that this is how the thing actually looks; this is its actual color, and the like.

<p><span class="font17">The following distinction should also be noted.

Only in the form of retention do we have a consciousness of the phase which has just flowed away, or else<sup>211</sup> in the form of a retrospective recollection. And my whole stream of mental processes is, finally, a unity of mental processes which, of essential necessity, cannot be seized upon completely in a perceiving which &quot;swims along with it.&quot; But </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font17"> incompleteness or &quot;imperfection,'' pertaining to the essence of the perception of a mental process, is radically different from the incompleteness or &quot;imperfection'' pertaining to the essence of the perception of something &quot;transcendent,&quot; perception by means of adumbrative presentation, by means of something such as appearance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">We now add the following contrast. Gradual differences in relative clarity or obscurity belong to the essence of presentiations. Obviously this difference in perfection has nothing to do with the one related to givenness by virtue of adumbrative appearances. A more or less clear objectivation is not adumbrated by the degree of clarity, namely in the sense which determines our terminology, according to which a spatial shape, any quality which covers a shape, and therefore the whole &quot;appearing physical thing as appearing&quot; is manifoldly adumbrated —whether the objectivation of them is clear or obscure. A reproductive objectivation of a physical thing has its various possible degrees of clarity and, more particularly, for each of its modes of adumbration. One sees that it is a matter of differences that lie in different dimensions. It is also obvious that the distinctions we make within the sphere of perception itself under the headings of &quot;clear and unclear<sup>),</sup>, &quot;distinct and indistinct<sup>55</sup> seeing do indeed exhibit a certain analogy with the differences in clarity of which we were just now speaking in so far as, in both cases, it is a matter of gradual increases and decreases in the fullness with which the objectivated affair is given; but these differences also belong to other dimensions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">If we penetrate more deeply into this situation we also understand the following difference in essence between mental processes and physical things with respect to their perceivableness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The kind of being belonging to mental processes is such that a seeing regard of perception can be directed quite immediately to any actual mental process as an originary living present. This occurs in the form of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;reflection^<sup>212,</sup></span><span class="font17"> which has the remarkable property that what is seized upon perceptually in reflection is characterized fundamentally not only as something which exists and endures while it is being regarded perceptually but also as something which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">already existed before</span><span class="font17"> this regard was turned to it. &quot;AH mental processes are intended to:&quot; This signifies, then, that in the specific caseofintentive </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">84</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">mental processes not only are they consciousness of something and</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">present<sup>213</sup> as consciousness of something when they themselves are the Objects of a reflecting consciousness, but also that they are there already as a &quot;background&quot; when they are not reflected on and thus of essential necessity are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;ready to be perceived<sup>1</sup>'</span><span class="font17"> in a sense which is, in the first place, analogous to the one in which unnoticed physical things in our external field of regard are ready to be perceived. Physical things can be ready to be perceived only in so far as already, as unnoticed things, they are intended to and this signifies: only if they are appearing. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Not all</span><span class="font17"> physical things fulfill this condition: the Afield of attentive regard^^ embracing everything which appears is not infinite. On the other hand, the mental process which is not reflected on also must fulfill certain conditions of readiness, although in quite different ways and as befits its essence. After all, it cannot be &quot;appearing.&quot; Nevertheless it fulfills those conditions at all times by the mere mode of its existence; it fulfills them, more particularly, for the particular Ego to which it belongs, the Ego-regard which, perchance, lives &quot;in&quot; it. Only because reflection and the mental process have those </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essential</span><span class="font17"> peculiarities which have been mentioned here, is it possible for us to know something about mental processes, including reflections themselves, which are not reflected on. That reproductive (and retentional) modifications of mental processes have the same determination, correspondingly modified, is obvious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us develop that contrast further. We see that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the sort of being which belongs to the mental process is such that the latter is essentially capable of being perceived in reflection.</span><span class="font17"> The physical thing is also essentially </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">capable of being perceived,</span><span class="font17"> and it is seized upon in perception as a physical thing belonging to my surrounding world.

The background field, understood as a field of simple observability, includes only a small piece of my surrounding world.

<p><span class="font17">From all of this there emerge important consequences. Every perception of something immanent necessarily guarantees the existence of its object. If reflective seizing-upon is directed to a mental process of mine, I have seized upon something absolute itself, the factual being of which is essentially incapable of being negated, i.e., the insight that it is essentially impossible for it not to exist; it would be a countersense to believe it possible that a mental process </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">given in that manner</span><span class="font17"> does </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font17"> in truth exist.

<p><span class="font17">To each stream of mental processes and to each Ego, as Ego, there belongs the essential possibility of acquiring this evidence; each bears in itself, as an essential possibility, the guarantee<sup>218</sup> of its absolute factual being. But, one might ask, is it not conceivable that an Ego have only phantasies in its stream of mental processes, that this stream consists ofnothing but inventive intuitions? Such an Ego would find only phantasies </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Fiktionen]</span><span class="font17"> of cogitationes; its reflections, because of the nature of these mental processes as the medium &lt;in which it reflected&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[bei der Natur des Erlebnismediums],</span><span class="font17"> would be exclusively reflections in imagination. — But that is an obvious countersense. What hovers before one may be a mere figment; the hovering itself, the inventive consciousness, is not itself invented and there belongs to its essence, as to any other mental process, the possibility of a perceiving reflection which seizes upon absolute factual being. No countersense<sup>219</sup> is implicit in the possibility that every other consciousness, which I posit in empathic experience, is non-existent.<sup>220</sup> But </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font17"> empathizing, my consciousness of whatever sort,<sup>221</sup> is originarily and absolutely given not only with respect to its essence but also with respect to its existence.

The being of mental processes may involve identifiability and therefore an ability to go back to them again; it may be that the absoluteness of components belonging to recollection and an apodictic content are presupposed and, above all, if I am to speak of my life, my stream of mental processes, my identical being as an Ego, in their own essential purity: But one secs in advance that here an answer may be possible and that there is a content, in itself absolutely concrete and self-con tai ned ly unitary, in itself indefeasibly existent, as the content in which alone I can experience, know, and in acting presuppose, the world and my human being as a worldly real existence, and that thus there is a pure, own essential being prior to the being of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In contradistinction, as we know, it is of the essence of the physical world that no perception, however perfect, presents anything absolute in that realm; and essentially connected with this is the fact that any experience, however extensive, leaves open the possibility that what is given does </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font17"> exist in spite of the continual consciousness ofits own presence &quot;in person.<sup>55</sup> According to eidetic law it is the case that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">physical existence<sup>223</sup> is never required as necessary</span><span class="font17"> by the givenness of something physical, but is always in a certain manner contingent. This means: It can always be that the further course of experience necessitates giving up what has already been posited with a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">legitimacy derived from experience.</span><span class="font17"> Afterwards one says it was a mere illusion, a hallucination, merely a coherent dream, or the like. Furthermore, as a continuously open possibility in this sphere of givenness, there exists such a thing as alteration of construing, a sudden changing of one appearance into another which cannot be united harmoniously with it and thus an influx of the latter upon the earlier experiential positings owing to which the intentional objects of these earlier positings suffer afterwards, so to speak, a transformation — occurrences all of which are essentially excluded from the sphere of mental processes.<sup>224</sup> In this absolute sphere<sup>225</sup> there is no room for conflict, illusion, or being otherwise. It is a sphere of absolute positing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus in every manner it is clear that whatever is there for me in the world of physical things<sup>226</sup> is necessarily only a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">presumptive actuality </span><span class="font17">and, on the other hand, that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">I myself,</span><span class="font17"> for whom it is there (I, when the &quot;part of me&quot; belonging to the world of physical things is excluded)<sup>227 </sup>am </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">absolute</span><span class="font17"> actuality or that the present phase of my mental processes is an absolute actuality, given by an unconditional, absolutely indefeasible positing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Over against the positing &quot;&nbsp;the world, which is a<sup>iQ</sup> contingent' positing, there stands then the positing of my pure Ego and Ego4ife which is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> '&quot;necessary^ </span><span class="font17">absolutely indubitable </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positing. Anything physical which is given</span><span class="font7"> &quot;加 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">person&quot; can be non-existent;<sup>223</sup> no mental process which is given ^inpersorC&quot; can</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">be non-existent.</span><span class="font17"> This is the eidetic law defining this necessity and that contingency.<sup>229</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Obviously that does not imply that the necessity of the being of this or that present mental process is a pure essential necessity, that is: a purely eidetic particularity subsumed under an eidetic law; it is the necessity of a fact, and is called so because an eidetic law is involved in the fact and indeed, in this case, involved in the existence of the fact as fact. The ideal possibility of a reflection having the essential charac- &lt;87&gt; teristic of an evidently indefeasible positing of </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">factual existence</span><span class="font17"> is grounded in the essence of </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">any<sup>230</sup></span><span class="font17"> Ego </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">whatever</span><span class="font17"> and of </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font17"> mental process </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">whatever.<sup>231</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The deliberations just carried out also make it clear that no conceivable proofs gathered from experiential consideration of the world could make the existence of the world certain for us with an absolute assurance. The world is dubitable not in the sense that rational motives are present to be taken into consideration over against the tremendous force of harmonious experiences, but rather in the sense that a doubt is </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">conceivable</span><span class="font17"> because, of essential necessity, the possibility of the non-being of the world is never excluded.<sup>232</sup> Any force of experience, no matter how great, can gradually become counterbalanced and outweighed. The absolute being of mental processes is in no respect altered thereby; in fact, they always remain presupposed by all of that.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Taking the results of the last chapter as our point of departure, we may take the following into consideration. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font17"> course of our human experiences is such that it constrains our reason to go beyond intuitionally given physical things (those of the Cartesian imaginatio) and base them on the &quot;truth of physics?<sup>5</sup> But that course &lt;88&gt; might be different. It is not as though human development had never progressed, nor would ever progress, beyond the prescientific stage so that, while the world of physics indeed had its truth, we should never know anything about it. And it is not as though the world of physics were different and ordered according to laws different from the ones that in fact obtain. Rather it is conceivable that our intuited world were the ultimate one, “behind&quot; which would be no world of physics whatever, i.e., that perceived physical things would lack mathematical or physical determination, that the data of experience would exclude any physics belonging to the same kind with ours. The concatenations of experience would then be correspondingly other and different in kind from what they in fact are in so far as the experiential motives fundamental to the fashioning of the concepts and judgments of physics would be absent. But, on the whole, within the limits of the presentive </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intuitions</span><span class="font17"> which we comprehend under the name &quot;simple experience<sup>,5</sup> (perception, recollection, etc.), ''physical things&quot; can still be presented as they are now as intentional unities persisting continuously in multiplicities of appearances.<sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17">But we can go further in this direction: No limits check us in the<sup>2 </sup>process of conceiving the destruction of the Objectivity of something physical — as the correlate of experimental consciousness. It must always be borne in mind here that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">whatever physical things are</span><span class="font17"> — the only physical things about which we can make statements, the only ones about the being or non-being, the being-thus or being-otherwise of which we can disagree and make rational decisions — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">they are as experienceable physical things.</span><span class="font17"> It is experience alone that prescribes their sense; and, since we are speaking of physical things in fact, it is actual experience alone which does so in its definitely ordered experiential concatenations. But if the kinds of mental processes included under experience, and especially the fundamental mental process of perceiving physical things, can be submitted by us to an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic</span><span class="font17"> consideration, and if we can discern essential possibilities and necessities in them (as we obviously can) and can therefore eidetically trace the essentially possible variants of motivated experiential concatenations: then the result is the correlate of our factual experience, called </span><span class="font7">&quot;统</span><span class="font17">e </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actual world/<sup>9</sup></span><span class="font17"> as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one special case among </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> multitude of possible worlds and surrounding worlds</span><span class="font17"> which, for their part, are nothing else but the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">correlates of essentially possible variants of the idea,<sup>((</sup>an experiencing conscious-</span><span class="font17">&lt;89&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ness^</span><span class="font17"> with more or less orderly concatenations of experience. As a consequence, one must not let oneselfbe deceived by speaking of the physical thing as transcending consciousness or as &quot;existing in itself.&quot; The genuine concept of the transcendence of something physical which is the measure of the rationality of any statements about transcendence, can itself be derived only from the proper essential contents of perception or from those concatenations of definite kinds which we call demonstrative experience. The idea of such transcendence is therefore the eidetic correlate of the pure idea of this demonstrative experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This is true of any conceivable kind of transcendence which could be treated as either an actuality or a possibility. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">An object existing in itself is never one with ivhich consciousness or the Ego pertaining to consciousness has nothing to do.</span><span class="font17"> The physical thing is a thing belonging to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">surrounding world</span><span class="font17"> even if it be an unseen physical thing, even if it be a really possible, unexperienced but experienceable, or perhaps experienceable, physical thing. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Experienceableness never means</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mere logical possibility,</span><span class="font17"> but rather a possibility </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">motivated</span><span class="font17"> in the concatenat-</span></p>

It is exclusively a matter of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essential structures</span><span class="font17"> of such concatenations which, with respect to all their possibilities, can be made the objects of a purely eidetic exploration. It is inherent in the essence that anything whatever which exists in reality but is not yet actually experienced can become given and that this means that the thing in question belongs to the undetermined but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">determinable</span><span class="font17"> horizon of my experiential actuality at the particular time. This horizon, however, is the correlate of the components of undeterminateness essentially attached to experiences of physical things themselves; and those components — again, essenti- &lt;90&gt; ally — leave open possibilities of fulfillment which are by no means completely undetermined but are, on the contrary, motivated possibilities </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">predelineated with respect to their essential type.</span><span class="font17"> Any actual experience points beyond itself to possible experiences which, in turn, point to new possible experiences and so ad infinitum.

<p><span class="font17">Now let us add the results reached at the end of the last chapter; let us recall the possibility of non-being of everything physically transcendent: it then becomes evident that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">while the being of consciousness,</span><span class="font17"> of any stream of mental processes whatever, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">would indeed be necessarily modified by an annihilation of the world cfphysical things it own existence would </span><span class="font17">&lt;92&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not be touched.</span><span class="font17"> Modified, to be sure. For an annihilation of the world means, correlatively, nothing else but that in each stream of mental processes (the full stream — the total stream, taken as endless in both directions, which comprises the mental processes of an Ego), certain ordered concatenations of experience and therefore certain complexes of theorizing reason oriented according to those concatenations of experience, would be excluded. But that does not mean that other mental processes and concatenations of mental processes would be excluded. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Consequently no real being,</span><span class="font17"> no being which is presented and legitimated in consciousness by appearances, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is necessary to the being of consciousness itself</span><span class="font17"> (in the broadest sense, the stream of mental processes).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Immanental being is therefore indubitably absolute being in the sense that by essential necessity immanental being nulla '%'' indiget ad existendum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">In contradistinction, the world of transcendent ^res^ is entirely referred to consciousness and, more particularly, not to some logically conceived consciousness but to actual consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In so far as its most universal sense is concerned, that has already been made clear by the exposition above (in the preceding sections). A something transcendent is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">given<sup>20</sup></span><span class="font17"> by virtue of certain concatenations of experience. As given directly<sup>21</sup> and with increasing perfection in perceptual continua which show themselves to be harmonious and in certain methodical forms of thinking based on experience, a something transcendent acquires, more or less immediately, its insightful, continually progressive determination. Let us assume that consciousness, with its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">constituent mental processes</span><span class="font17"> and with the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">course it</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">^Insertion in Copy A:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> though, of essential necessity, only with a proviso</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">runs,</span><span class="font17"> is actually of such a nature that the conscious subject, in his free activity of theoretical experiencing and of thinking oriented according to experience,<sup>22</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">could</span><span class="font17"> effect all such concatenations (in which connection we should also have to take into account the reinforcement received by mutual understanding with other Egos and other streams of mental processes) ;<sup>23</sup>let us assume, furthermore, that the pertinent regularities of consciousness are actually maintained,<sup>24 </sup>that, in the course of consciousness taken universally, nothing whatever is lacking which is requisite for the appearance of a unitary world and for the rational theoretical cognition of such a world. All that being assumed, we now ask: is it still </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">conceivable</span><span class="font17"> and not rather a countersense that the corresponding transcendent world </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">does not exist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus we see that consciousness (mental process) and real being are anything but coordinate kinds of being, which dwell peaceably side by side and occasionally become &quot;related to&quot; or ''connected with&quot; one another. Only things which are essentially akin, the respective proper essences of which have a like sense, can become connected in &lt;93&gt; the true sense of the word, can make up a whole. An immanental or absolute being and a transcendent being are, of course, both called &quot;existent,'' an &quot;object,&quot; and have, more particularly, their objective determining contents. But it is evident that what is called &quot;an object<sup>55 </sup>and &quot;an objective determination<sup>55</sup> in the one case, and what is called by the same name in the other case, are called so only with reference to the empty logical categories. In so far as their respective senses are concerned, a veritable abyss yawns between consciousness and reality. Here, an adumbrated being, not capable of ever becoming given absolutely,<sup>25</sup> merely accidental and relative;<sup>26</sup> there, a necessary and absolute being, essentially incapable of becoming given by virtue of adumbration and apprearance.<sup>27</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus it becomes clear that, in spite of all our assuredly well-founded statements about the real being of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">human</span><span class="font17"> Ego and its conscious mental processes, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font17"> the world and about everything in the way of &quot;psychophysical&quot; interconnections pertaining to them — that, in spite of all that, consciousness considered in its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^punty&quot;</span><span class="font17"> must be held to be a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">self-contained complex of being,</span><span class="font17"> a complex of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">absolute being </span><span class="font17">into which nothing can penetrate and out of which nothing can slip, to which nothing is spatiotemporally external and which cannot be within any spatiotemporally complex, which cannot be affected by any physical thing<sup>28</sup> and cannot exercise causation upon any physical thing — it being presupposed that causality has the normal sense of causality pertaining to Nature as a relationship of dependence between realities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the other hand, the whole </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">spatiotemporal world,</span><span class="font17"> which includes human being and the human Ego as subordinate single realities is, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">according to its sense, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> merely intentional being,</span><span class="font17"> thus one has the merely secondary sense of a being</span><span class="font7">加 </span><span class="font17">a consciousness.<sup>29</sup> It is a being posited by consciousness in its experiences which, of essential necessity, can be determined and intuited only as something identical belonging to<sup>30</sup> motivated multiplicities of appearences: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">beyond that</span><span class="font17"> it is nothing.<sup>31</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17">formed to the ordo et connexio idearum.<sup>32</sup> Reality, the reality of the physical thing taken singly and the reality of the whole world, lacks &lt;94&gt; self-sufficiency in virtue of its essence (in our strict sense of the word). Reality is not in itself something absolute which becomes tied secondarily to something else; rather, in the absolute sense, it is nothing at all; it has no ''absolute essence&quot; whatever; it has the essentiality of something which, of necessity, is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font17"> intentional, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font17"> an object of consciousness, something presented [ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Vorstelliges]</span><span class="font17"> in the manner peculiar to consciousness, something apparent &lt;as apparenb.<sup>33</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We now turn our thoughts back again to the first chapter, to our observations concerning the phenomenological reduction. It now becomes clear that, in contrast to the natural<sup>34</sup> theoretical attitude, the correlate of which is the world, a new attitude must in fact be possible which, in spite of the “exclusion&quot; of this psychophysical universe of Nature, leaves us something: the whole field of absolute consciousness. Instead, then, of living naively in experience and theoretically exploring what is experienced, transcendent Nature, we effect the ''phenomenological reduction.&quot; In other words, instead of naively </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">effecting</span><span class="font17"> the acts pertaining to our Nature </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">constituting consciousness<sup>35</sup> with their positings of something transcendent, and letting ourselves be induced, by motives implicit in them, to effect ever new positings of something transcendent — instead of that, we put all those positings<sup>36</sup> “out of action/<sup>5</sup> we do not ''participate in them;^^ we direct our seizing and theoretically inquiring regard to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure consciousness in its own absolute being.</span><span class="font17"> That, then, is what is left as the sought-fbr <sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;phenomenological residuum^</span><span class="font17"> though we have <sup>t&lt;</sup>excluded<sup>,</sup></span><span class="font11"><sup>，</sup></span><span class="font17"><sup>3? </sup>the whole world with all physical things, living beings, and humans, ourselves included.

Such considerations are necessary in order to know, moreover, that such a unity is given to us, and theoretically explorable by us, only in an attitude other than the one in which the consciousness ''constituting<sup>5</sup>* that unity, and likewise any absolute consciousness whatever, is explorable.47They are necessary in order that, in the face of our philosophical poverty in which, under the fine name of a &quot;world view founded on natural science,<sup>5,</sup> we are vainly fatiguing ourselves, it may at last become clear that a transcendental investigation of consciousness cannot signify an investigation of Nature<sup>48</sup> and cannot presuppose the latter as a premise because Nature<sup>49</sup> is as a matter of essential necessity parenthesized in the transcendental attitude. They are necessary in order to recognize that our disregarding of the whole world in the form of the phenomenological reduction is something totally different from a mere abstracting from components within more comprehensive interconnections, be they necessary or factual. If mental processes of consciousness were inconceivable without involvement with Nature </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the same fashion</span><span class="font17"> in which colors are inconceivable without extension, then we could not regard consciousness as an absolutely peculiar region by itself in the sense in which we must so regard it.

Yet even if we were emphasizing only the specifically natural, our consideration seems insufficient. We take the Object belonging to Nature, the material physical thing, only as the Object of mere sensuous imagination (sensuous experience).</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font17">the physical thing as determined by physics, for which the sensuously appearing (the perceptually given) physical thing is said to function as a &quot;mere appearance/<sup>5</sup> perhaps even as something &quot;merely subjective.<sup>,5</sup> Nevertheless it is already implicit in the sense of our earlier statements that this mere subjectivity ought not to be confused (as it is so frequently) with a subjectivity such as characterizes mental processes, as though the perceived physical things, with respect to their perceptual qualities, and as though these qualities themselves were mental processes. Not can it be the true opinion of scientific investigators of Nature (particularly if we keep, not to their pronouncements, but to the sense of their method) that the appearing physical thing is an illusion or a faulty </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">picture</span><span class="font17"> of the &quot;true&quot; physical thing as determined by physics. Likewise the statement that the determinations of the appearance are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">signs</span><span class="font17"> of the true determinations is misleading.<sup>61</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Are we then allowed to say, in accordance with the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;realism^</span><span class="font17"> which is very widely accepted: The actually perceived (and, in the primary sense, appearing) should, for its part, be regarded as an appearance of, or an instinctive basis for, inferring something else, intrinsically foreign to it and<sup>62</sup> separated from it?

<p><span class="font17">Already, on the basis of our general presentations (which will be greatly deepened and undergo continual confirmation by our further analyses), it becomes evident that such theories are possible only as long as one avoids seriously fixing one<sup>5</sup>s eyes on, and scientifically exploring, the sense ofa physical thing-datum and, therefore, of &quot;any physical thing whatever/<sup>5</sup> a sense implicit in experience's own </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence </span><span class="font17">—the sense which functions as the absolute norm for all rational discourse about physical things.

Even the greatest scientific investigators have</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">and that, without doubt, is true of all epistemological theories of the type indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It could easily be shown that if the supposed unknown cause </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">existed </span><span class="font17">at all, it would have to be </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essentially</span><span class="font17"> perceivable and experienceable if not by us then by other Egos who see better and further. What is in question here is not, perchance, an empty, merely logical possibility but rather an essential possibility which is rich in content and valid with that content. Furthermore, it could be shown that the possible perception itself<sup>64</sup> would, as a matter of essential necessity, have to be another case of perception by means of appearances and that, consequently, we should fall into an inevitable infinite regress. It could be pointed out, moreover, that an explanation of perceptually given processes by hypothetically assumed causative realities, by unknown physical affairs (for example, the explanation of certain planetary disturbances by the assumption of an as-yet-unknown planet, Neptune) is something essentially different from an explanation in the sense of a determining of experienced physical things in the manner peculiar to physics — an explanation by such physical-scientific means as atoms, ions, and the like. In this manner a great many points having a similar sense might be developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Here we need not enter into a systematically exhaustive discussion of all such matters. It is sufficient for our purposes to bring out distinctly a few main points. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">99</span><span class="font7">〉</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We begin with the easily verified statement that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">perceived physical</span><span class="font17"> thing itself is always and necessarily </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">precisely the thing which the physicist explores and scientifically determines following the method of physics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This proposition seems to contradict the propositions stated earlier<sup>65</sup> in which we sought to determine more precisely the sense of certain locutions commonly used by physicists and the sense of the traditional distinction between primary and secondary qualities. After eliminating obvious misinterpretations we said that the &quot;'experienced physical thing proper” gives us the &quot;mere This/<sup>5</sup> an &quot;empty JT' which becomes the bearer of the exact determinations ascribed in physics which do not themselves fall within experience proper. The being which is &quot;true according to physics&quot; would therefore &quot;of essential necessity be determined quite diflfercntly&quot;</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">Nevertheless, the two presentations are quite compatible and we need not quarrel seriously with that interpretation of the conception involved in physics. We need only understand it correctly. By no means ought we to fall into either the picture-theory or the signtheory, the fundamentally wrong theories which we considered earlier without particular regard to the physical thing as determined in physics and which we likewise refuted in a radically universal manner.<sup>66</sup> A picture or a sign refers to something lying outside it which would &quot;itself' be seized upon were we to go over into a different mode of objectivation, into that of presentive intuition. In themselves, a sign or a picture do not <sup>€t</sup>make known^^ the designated (or depictured) affair itself.<sup>67</sup> The physical thing as determined by physics, however, is nothing foreign to what appears sensuously &quot;in person;'' rather it is something which makes itselfknown originaliter in it and, more particularly, </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">priori</span><span class="font17"> (for indefeasible eidetic reasons) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font17"> in it. Accordingly, even the sensuous determination-content of the X which functions as bearer of the determinations ascribed in physics is no clothing foreign to these determinations and hiding them: rather, only because the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">X</span><span class="font17"> is the subject of the sensuous determinations is it the subject also of the determinations ascribed in physics which, for their part, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">make themselves known</span><span class="font17"> in<sup>68</sup> the sensuous determinations. According to what has been set forth in detail, it is necessary that a physical thing, and precisely the physical thing of which the physicist speaks, can be given only sensuously in sensuous &quot;modes of appearance;'' and the identical appearing in the changing continuity of these modes of appearance is what the physicist subjects to a causal analysis<sup>69</sup> in its relationship to all experienceable (thus perceived or perceivable) concatenations which can be considered as &quot;circumstances,&quot; an exploration with respect to its necessary real connections with them. The physical thing which he observes, with which he experiments, which he continually sees, takes in his hand, puts on the scale or in the melting furnace: that physical thing, and no other, becomes the subject of the predicates ascribed in physics,</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">such as weight, temperature, electrical resistance, and so forth. Likewise, it is the perceived processes and concatenations themselves which become determined by means of concepts such as force, acceleration, energy, atom, ion, etc. The sensuously appearing thing, which has the sensuous shapes, colors, odor- and taste-properties, is thus anything but a sign for some </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">other</span><span class="font17"> thing; rather it is, so to speak, a sign </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">for itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>70</sup>Only this much can be said: The physical thing appearing with such and such sensuous determinations under the given phenomenal circumstances </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is, for the physicist,</span><span class="font17"> who has </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">already carried out</span><span class="font17"> in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universal </span><span class="font17">manner for all such physical things, in phenomenal concatenations of the sort in question, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">their determination by means of concepts peculiar to physics,</span><span class="font17"> an indicative sign ofa wealth of causal properties belonging to this same physical thing which, as causal properties, make themselves known in phenomenal dependencies of familiar sorts. What makes itself known here — by being made known in intentional unities pertaining to mental processes of consciousness — is obviously something essentially transcendent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">According to all this it is clear that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">even the higher transcendency characterizing the physical thing as determined by physics does not</span><span class="font17"> signify </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reaching out beyond the world which is for consciousness,</span><span class="font17"> or for every Ego functioning as a cognizing subject (singly or in an empathic context).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Indicated in a universal way, the situation is this, that the thinking pertaining to physics establishes itself on the foundation laid by natural experiencing (or by natural positings which it effects). Following the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">rational motives</span><span class="font17"> presented to it by the concatenations of experience, it is compelled to effect certain modes of conception, certain intentional constructions required by reason, and to effect them for the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">theoretical determination</span><span class="font17"> of sensuously experienced things. Precisely because of this there arises the contrast between the physical thing as object of the sensuous imaginatio simpliciter and the physical thing as object of the physicist's intellectio; and, for the latter side, all the ideally inherent ontological formations produced by thinking accrue which become expressed in the concepts peculiar to &lt;101&gt; physics and which draw, and should draw, their sense exclusively from the method of natural science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If experiential-logical reason, under the name of physics, fashions in this manner an intentional correlate belonging to a higher level —</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">In a countersensical manner one thus connects by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">causality</span><span class="font17"> things pertaining to the senses and physical things as determined by physics. As a consequence, in the usual realism, however, one confuses the sensuous appearances by virtue of their &quot;mere subjectivity,^ i.e., the appearing objects, as appearing (which are themselves already something transcendent), with the absolute mental processes of any appearing, of any experiencing consciousness whatever, which is constituting them. Everywhere this confusion is perpetrated in at least </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">this form:</span><span class="font17"> one speaks as though Objective physics were engaged not in explaining the <sup>u</sup>physical thing-appearances^ in the sense of the physical things appearing, but in the sense of the constituting </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mental processes</span><span class="font17"> of experiencing consciousness.<sup>72</sup> Causality, which belongs essentially to the context of the constituted intentional world and has sense only within that world, is now made not merely into a mythical bond between the &quot;Objective&quot; being which physics determines and the &quot;subjective&quot; being which appears in immediate experience — the <sup>u</sup>merely subjective^ thing pertaining to the senses with the &quot;scc-ondary qualities&quot;——;rather, by the illegitimate shifting from the latter to the consciousness constituting it, causality is made into a bond between the being which physics determines and absolute consciousness and, specifically, the pure mental processes of experiencing. In so doing, one attributes a mythical absolute reality to the being determined by physics, while completely failing to see what is truly absolute: pure consciousness as pure consciousness in its purity. Accordingly, no note is taken of the absurdity involved in absolutizing Nature as conceived by physics, in absolutizing this intentional correlate of logically determinative thinking; and likewise no note is taken of the absurdity in making this Nature, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">determines the directly intuited physical world in terms of experiential logic and which, in this function, is fully </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">known</span><span class="font17"> (so that to look for something behind it makes no sense) into an unknown and only secretely indicated reality which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">itself</span><span class="font17"> can never be apprehended with respect to any determination of its own, and to which one now imputes the role of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">causative</span><span class="font17"> reality in relation to the courses of subjective appearances and experiencing mental processes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A not insignificant influence is exercised in these misinterpretations by the circumstance that one misinterprets the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">lack of sensuous intuitability</span><span class="font17"> which is a property of all catego rial unities produced by thinking (and is particularly striking, naturally, in the case of those formed at a highly mediated level) as well as the useful inclination in the practice of cognition to attach sensuous images, &quot;models,&quot; to these unities: that which is not intuitable sensuously is understood to be a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">symbolic representative</span><span class="font17"> of something hidden, which could become an object of simple sensuous intuition if there were a better intellectual organization; and the models are understood to serve as intuited schematic pictures in place of this hidden reality having, accordingly, a function similar to that belonging to the hypothetical drawings of extinct living beings<sup>73</sup> which the paleontologist makes on the basis of meagre Data. One does not pay attention to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">evident</span><span class="font17"> sense of the constructional unities produced by thinking, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as constructional; </span><span class="font17">and one overlooks the fact that here the hypothetical is restricted to the sphere of cogitative synthesis. Not even a Divine physics<sup>74</sup> can make simply intuited determinations out of those categorial determinations of realities which are produced by thinking, any more than a Divine omnipotence can bring it to pass that someone paints elliptic functions or plays them on the violin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However greatly this exposition needs deepening, however sensible to us because of the need for a full clarification of all relevant matters may be, what we require for our purposes has become evident to us: that of essential necessity the transcendency belonging to the physical thing as determined by physics is the transcendency belonging to a being which becomes constituted in, and tied to, consciousness, and that the taking into consideration of mathematical natural science (no matter how many particular enigmas may be involved in its cognition) in no way alters our results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It requires no special explanation<sup>75</sup> to see that everything we have made clear to ourselves with respect to Objectivities belonging to Nature, as &quot;mere things/<sup>5</sup> must hold in the case of all </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">axiological,</span><span class="font17"> and &lt;all&gt; practical Objectivities which are founded on them:<sup>76</sup> all aesthetic objects, all cultural formations, etc. And, likewise, in the case of all transcendencies of whatever sort which become constituted in the manner peculiar to consciousness.<sup>77</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Great importance is attached to another extension of the limits within which we have confined our observations. We have included within the sphere of our findings the whole of material Nature, appearing sensuously, and the nature founded in the latter and determined by physics at a higher level of cognition. But what about </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">animate realities^</span><span class="font17"> humans and beasts? What about their psyches and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">psychical mental processes?</span><span class="font17"> The complete world is not merely physical; it is also psychophysical.<sup>78</sup> It must ——who can deny it?——include all the streams of consciousness connected with animated organisms. Thus, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">on the one hand consciousness is said to be the absolute</span><span class="font17"> in which everything transcendent and, therefore, ultimately the whole psychophysical world, becomes constituted; and, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">on the other hand,</span><span class="font17"> consciousness is said to be a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">subordinate real event within that ivorld.</span><span class="font17"> How can these statements be reconciled?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us make clear to ourselves how consciousness, so to speak, can enter into the real world, how that which in itself is absolute can relinguish its immanence and take on the characteristic of transcendence.<sup>79</sup> We immediately see that it can do so only by a certain</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">participation in transcendence in the first, the originary sense</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> and this is obviously the transcendence belonging to Nature. Only by virtue of its experienced relation to the organism does consciousness become real human or brute consciousness, and only thereby does it acquire a place in the space belonging to Nature and the time belonging to Nature — the time which is physically measured. We also recall that only by virtue of the<sup>80</sup> connection joining a consciousness and an<sup>81</sup> organism to make up an empirically intuited unity within Nature<sup>82</sup> is any such thing as mutual understanding between animate beings pertaining to a world possible; and that only thereby can any cognizing subject<sup>83</sup> find the complete world and at the same time know it as one and the same surrounding world belonging in common to him and to all other subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">peculiar kind of apprehending or experiencing,</span><span class="font17"> a peculiar kind of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;apperception^</span><span class="font17"> effects the production of this so-called &quot;annexation J this reification </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Realisierung]</span><span class="font17"> of consciousness. Regardless of that whereof this apperception consists, or of what particular kind of demonstration it may demand, this much is obvious: Consciousness itself, in these apperceptive involvements or in this psychophysical relationship to something corporeal, loses none of its own essence and can take up into itself nothing alien to its essence; indeed, that would</span><span class="font7">〈 </span><span class="font17">104</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">be a countersense.<sup>84</sup> Corporeal being is essentially a being which appears, which becomes presented by virtue of sensuous adumbration.

<p><span class="font17">And still it has become something other, a component part of Nature. In itself, it is what it is by its absolute essence.

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">scendence</span><span class="font17"> of a peculiar kind becomes constituted: there now appears a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sequence</span><span class="font17"> of conscious </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">states</span><span class="font17"> of an identical </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font17"> Ego-subject<sup>86</sup> which manifests in them its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">individual real properties</span><span class="font17"> and who now — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font17"> this unity of properties becoming manifest in states </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">is intended to as united with the appearing organism.

<p><span class="font17">As in the case of any other transcending apperception, so here </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">tivo attitudes</span><span class="font17"> are essentially effected.

On the other hand, we have the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenological attitude</span><span class="font17"> combined with the latter<sup>89</sup> as an essential possibility which, reflecting and excluding the positings of something transcendent, is a turning toward absolute, pure consciousness and finds, as an absolute mental process, the apperception of a sequence of states: thus, in the example above, the affective mental process of rejoicing as an absolute phenomenological datum, but in the medium of an apprehensional function which animates it — precisely the function of &quot;manifesting&quot; a sequence of states connected with the appearing organism and belonging to a human Ego-subject. The &quot;pure&quot; mental process<sup>90</sup> &quot;lies,&quot; in a certain sense, within what is psychologically apperceived, in the mental process as a human state; in its own essence it takes on the form of a sequence of states and with that form its intentional relationship to </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">105</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">the human Ego and the human organism.<sup>91</sup> If the mental process in question — in our example, the feeling of rejoicing — loses that intentional form (and it is, after all, conceivable), it does indeed undergo an alteration, but only in that it is thereby simplified so that</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Let us imagine that we effect natural apperceptions, but that our apperceptions are always invalid<sup>93</sup> since they allow for no harmonious concatenations in which experienced unities might become constituted. In other words, let us imagine that, in the manner described above,<sup>94</sup> the whole of Nature, in the first place, physical nature, is &quot;annihilated.<sup>,5</sup> Then there would be no more animate organisms and therefore no more human beings. I should no longer exist as a human being: and, a fortiori, no fellow human beings would exist for me. But my consciousness, greatly as the mental processes comprised in it would be altered, would remain a stream of absolute mental processes with its own essence. If anything were still left which allowed my mental processes to be apprehended as &quot;states&quot; of a personal<sup>95 </sup>Ego, states in the changes of which identical personal<sup>96</sup> psychical properties became manifest, we could dissolve those apprehendings, do away with the intentional forms which they constitute, and reduce &lt;my mental processes&gt; to pure mental processes.<sup>97</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Psychical states also</span><span class="font17"> point back to regularities of absolute mental processes in which they become constituted, in which they take on the intentional, and in its fashion, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">transcendent</span><span class="font17"> form </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;state</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">：</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span></p>

They take nothing away from the fully valid being of the world as the all of realities, just as nothing is taken away from the fully valid geometrical being of the square by denying that the square is round (a denial admittedly based, in this case, on what is immediately obvious). The real actuality is not &quot;reinterpreted J to say nothing of its being denied</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> it is rather that a countersensical interpretation of the real actuality, i.e., an interpretation which contradicts the latter's </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">own</span><span class="font17"> sense as clarified by insight, is removed. That interpretation stems from a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">philosophical</span><span class="font17"> absolutizing of the world completely alien to the natural way of considering the world. This is, precisely, natural; it lives naively in the effecting of the general positing described by us; thus it can never become a countersense. The countersense only arises when one philosophizes and, while seeking ultimate intelligence about the sense of the world, never even notices that the world itselfhas its whole being as a certain &quot;sense&quot; which presupposes absolute consciousness as the field where sense is bestowed;<sup>105</sup> and when, at the same time, one fails to notice that this field, this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sphere of being of absolute origins^ is accessible to</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">insightful inquiry [schauenden Forschung]</span><span class="font17"> yielding an infinite wealth of cognitions given in insight with the highest scientific dignity. The latter, to sure, is something which we have yet to show</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> only as these investigations progress will it become clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us note in conclusion that the universality with which, in the deliberations carried out above, we have spoken about the constitution of the natural world in absolute consciousness, should not be found objectionable. That we have not ventured empty philosophical conceits from on high but, on the basis of systematic fundamental work in this field, have concentrated in universal statements cautiously acquired cognitions will be evident to the scientifically experienced reader from the conceptual definiteness of the exposition. The need for more detailed statements and for filling in gaps which have been left open may be felt, and rightly so. The further presentations will furnish considerable contributions to a more concrete development of the sketches previously given. It should be noted, however, that our aim here has not been to give a finished theory of that transcendental constitution and, accordingly, to pro-</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">108 &gt;&nbsp;ject a new &quot;theory of knowledge&quot; pertaining to the various spheres of reality; &lt;our aim has been instead&gt; only to bring about insight into certain general thoughts which can help one to acquire the idea of transcendentally pure consciousness. For us what is essential is<sup>107 </sup>the<sup>108</sup> evidence that the phenomenological reduction, as an excluding of the natural attitude, or of the latter's general positing, is possible,<sup>109</sup> the evidence that, after we effect that reduction, absolute or transcendentally pure consciousness remains as a residuum to which reality cannot be ascribed without absurdity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">of continuing validity, the mode ofimmanental tradition, so to speak, having its sources in earlier experience and association.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§56. The Question About the Range of the Phenomenological Reduction. Natural and Cultural Sciences.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">The exclusion<sup>1</sup> of Nature was for us the methodic means for initially making possible the turning of regard to transcendentally pure consciousness. Now that we have brought it into the purvue of seeing regard, it is still useful to consider, conversely, what must remain excluded for the purpose ofan investigation ofpure consciousness and whether the necessary exclusion<sup>2</sup> concerns only the sphere of Nature. From the standpoint of the phenomenological science which we propose to establish, that signifies &lt;considering&gt; in addition </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">which sciences</span><span class="font17"> it might </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">draw from</span><span class="font17"> without violating its pure sense, which &lt;sciences&gt; it might and might not use as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">given beforehand,</span><span class="font17"> which, hence, need &quot;parenthesizing.&quot; Because of its peculiar essence as a science of &quot;origins,&quot; methodological questions of that sort, which are far removed from any naive (&quot;dogmatic&quot;) science, must be considered carefully by phenomenology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the first place, it is immediately understandable that, with the exclusion of the natural world, the physical and psychophysical<sup>3 </sup>world, all individual objectivities which become constituted by axiological and practical functionings of consciousness are excluded,<sup>4</sup> all the sorts ofcultural formations, all works of the technical and fine arts, of sciences (in so far as they come into question as cultural facts rather than as accepted unities), aesthetic and practical values of every form. Likewise, naturally, such actualities as state, custom, law, religion. Consequently, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all natural sciences and cultural sciences,</span><span class="font17"> with their total</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">stock of cognition, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">undergo exclusion^</span><span class="font17"> precisely as sciences which require the natural attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">109&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§57. The Question of the Exclusion of the Pure Ego [Ich/.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Difficulties arise at one limit. Human being as natural being and as person in personal association, in that of &quot;society,&quot; is excluded; likewise every other animate being. But what about the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure Ego?</span><span class="font17"> Has the phenomenological Ego which we also find become a transcendental nothing because of the phenomenological reduction? Let us reduce to the stream of pure consciousness. In reflection every cogitatio effected takes on the explicit form, cogito. Does it lose this form if we exercise the transcendental reduction?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This much is clear from the very beginning: After carrying out this reduction we shall not encounter the pure Ego anywhere in the flux of manifold mental process which remains as a transcendental residuum —neitheras one mental process amongothers, noras strictly a part of a mental process, arising and then disappearing with the mental process of which it is a part. The Ego seems to be there continually, indeed, necessarily, and this continualness is obviously not that of a stupidly persistent mental process, a &quot;fixed idea.&quot; Instead, the Ego belongs to each coming and going mental process; its &quot;regard&quot; is directed “through&quot; each actional cogito to the objective something. This ray of regard changes from one cogito to the next, shooting forth anew with each new cogito and vanishing with it. The Ego, however, is something identical. At least, considered eidetically, any cogito </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font17"> change, come and go, even though one may doubt that every cogito is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessarily </span><span class="font17">something transitory<sup>6</sup> and not simply, as we find it, something </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in fact </span><span class="font17">transitory. In contradistinction, the pure Ego would, however, seem to be something essentially </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessary;</span><span class="font17"> and, as something absolutely identical throughout every actual or possible change in mental processes, it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">cannot in any sense be </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> really inherent part or moment</span><span class="font17"> of the mental processes themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In every actional cogito the ego lives out its life in a special sense. But all mental processes in the background likewise belong to it; and it</span></p>

All of them, as belonging to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> stream of mental processes which is mine, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font17"> admit of becoming converted into actional cogitationes or incorporated into actional cogitationes as immanental constituents. In Kant's words,<sup>7</sup> &quot;The '/ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">think&quot; must be capable of accompanying all rny presentations.<sup>3</sup>&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If<sup>8</sup> we retain a pure Ego as a residuum after our phenomenological exclusion of the world and of the empirical subjectivity included in it (and an essentially different pure Ego for each stream of mental &lt;110&gt; processes), then there is presented in the case of that Ego a transcendency of a peculiar kind ——one which<sup>9</sup>is not constituted ——a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">transcendency within immanency.</span><span class="font17"> Because of the immediately essential role played by this transcendency in the case of any cogitation, we must not undertake its exclusion; though in many investigations the questions concerning the pure Ego can remain in suspense. Bu t only inso far as its immediate, evidently ascertainable essential peculiarity and its givenness along with pure consciousness extend do we propose to count the pure Ego as a phenomenological datum; all theories about it which exceed those limits undergo exclusion. I n the Second Book ofthis essay we shall find occasion, moreover, to devote a separate chapter to the difficult questions concerning the pure Ego; in that context we shall also make secure the position taken here in a preliminary way.<sup>10</sup></span></p>

Reduction of the natural world to the absolute of consciousness yields </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">factual</span><span class="font17"> concatenations of mental processes of consciousness of certain kinds with distinctive regular orders in which a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">morphologically</span><span class="font17"> or^r^rfworld in the sphere of empirical intuition becomes constituted as their intentional correlate, i.e., a world concerning which there can be classifying and describing sciences.

Inall this, since the ra/zonaZz/y made actual by the fact is nota rationality demanded by the essence, there is a marvelous </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">teleology.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;111 &gt;&nbsp;Furthermore: The systematic exploration of all teleologies to be found in the empirical world itself, for example the</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">factual</span><span class="font17"> evolution of the sequence of organisms as far as human being and, in the development of mankind, the growth of culture with its spiritual treasures, is not yet completed with the natural-scientific explanation of all such produced formations as coming from the given factual circumstances and according to the laws ofNature. Rather, the transition to pure consciousness by the method of transcendental reduction leads necessarily to the question about the ground for the now-emerging factualness of the corresponding constitutive consciousness. Not the fact as such, but the fact as source of endlessly increasing value-possibilities and value-actualities forces the question into one about the &quot;ground&quot; —which naturally does not have the sense ofa physical-causal reason. We pass over whatever else, from the point of view of religious consciousness, is able, as a rationally grounding motive, to lead to the same principle. What concerns us here, after merely indicating diflerent groups of such rational grounds lor &lt;&nbsp;believing in&gt; the existence of an extra-worldly &quot;divine&quot; being is that this being would obviously transcend not merely the world but &quot;absolute&quot; consciousness. It would therefore be an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;absolute&quot; in the sense totally different from that in which consciousness is</span><span class="font17"> an absolute, just as it would be </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">something transcendent in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> sense totally different</span><span class="font17"> from that in which the world is something transcendent.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§59 . The Transcendency of the Eidetic. Exclusion of Pure Logic as Mathesis Universalis.<sup>12</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Having excluded individual realities in every sense of the word, we now attempt to exclude all other sorts of<sup>4</sup>'transcendencies.<sup>55</sup> This attempt concerns the set of “universal&quot; objects, of essences. They are also &quot;transcendent<sup>55</sup> to pure consciousness ina certain manner; they are not to be found as really inherent within it. Nevertheless, we cannot go on excluding transcendencies without limit; transcendental purification cannot mean an exclusion </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of all</span><span class="font17"> transcendencies since otherwise even though a pure consciousness would indeed remain, there would not remain, however, any possibility of a science of pure consciousness. &lt;112&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us make this clear. Let us attempt the maximum possible exclusion of the eidetic and consequently a like exclusion of all eidetic sciences. To each regionally delimitable sphere ofindividual being, in the broadest logical sense, there belongs an ontology. For example, an ontology ofNature belongs to physical nature; an ontology of psychophysical being to the psychophysical. All of these disciplines, whether already developed or merely required, undergo reduction. In contrast to the material ontologies, we find “fbrmal'' ontology (united with the formal logic of significations produced by thinking), to which the quasi-region, &quot;any object whatever/<sup>5</sup> belongs. If we try to exclude in addition &lt;fbrmal ontology&gt;, doubts arise which will, at the same time, concern the possibility of an unrestricted exclusion of the eidetic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The following series of thoughts emerge. To each province ofbeing we must attach, for the purposes of science, certain eidetic spheres as adjunts, not simplyas provinces ofresearch but as places into which the investigator of the province in question must be allowed to reach for eidetic cognitions whenever the interconnected theoretical motives within the essential peculiarity of that province incline him to do so. Above all, every investigator mustsurely be able to freely call on formal logic (or formal ontology). For no matter what things he may be investigating, they are always objects; and whatever is true fbrmaliter ofany objects whatever<sup>13</sup> (any properties whatever, any predicatively formed affair-complexes whatever, and the like), that too is his. And no matter how he frames concepts and propositions, draws conclusions, etc., what formal logic establishes with formal universality regarding</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Addition to title of section in</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Co</span><span class="font7">勤 </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Ihe Norm of Phenomenology </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Insertion in Copy A:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> with respect to all their categorially produced forms</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">such significations and their genera, concerns him too and, in the same manner, any other investigator of the special sciences. Therefore it concerns the phenomenologist. Every pure mental process is also subsumed under the logically broadest sense of the word, object. It appears that we are consequently unable to exclude formal logic or formal ontology. And, for obviously similar reasons, we should also be unable to exclude universal noetics which enounces eidetic insights concerning the rationality or irrationality of any judgmental thinking the significational contents of which are determined only in formal universality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But if we consider the situation more closely, we see that, given certain presuppositions, there arises a possibility of “parenthesizing&quot; formal logic and consequently all the disciplines of formal mathesis (algebra, theory of numbers, theory of manifolds, etc.). If we presuppose, namely, that the investigation of pure consciousness by phenomenology does not and need not impose any problems other &lt;113&gt; than those of a descriptive analysis which can be solved in pure intuition, then neither the forms<sup>14</sup> of theories of the mathematical disciplines nor any derivative theorems of the latter can be of use to phenomenology. Where the fashioning of concepts and judgments is not a process of constructing them, where no systems of mediate deductions are built, the doctrine offbrms<sup>15</sup> of all deductive systems, as found in mathematics, cannot function as an instrument in material research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now phenomenology is, in fact, a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely descriptive</span><span class="font17"> discipline, exploring the field of transcendentally pure consciousness by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure intuition.</span><span class="font17"> The only propositions of logic to which phenomenology might ever have occasion to refer would therefore be mere logical </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">axioms,</span><span class="font17"> like the law ofcontradiction, axioms the universal and absolute validity of which it would be able<sup>16</sup> to make evident, however, on the basis of examples included among its own data. Therefore we can extend the explicitly excluding </span><span class="font7">专兀</span><span class="font17">0%</span><span class="font7">九 </span><span class="font17">to formal logic and to mathesis in its entirety and, in so doing, be assured of the legitimacy of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">norm</span><span class="font17"> which we, as phenomenologists intend to follow: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">To avail ourselves of nothing but what </span><span class="font17">/e </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can make essentially evident by observing consciousness itself</span><span class="font17"> in its pure immanence.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At the same time we thus acquire the explicit knowledge that a descriptive phenomenology is essentially independent of all those disciplines. In connection with a utilization of phenomenology for philosophical purposes, this finding is not without importance; and it is therefore advantageous to take note of it on this occasion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§60 . The Exclusion of Material-Eidetic Disciplines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">As for what now concerns the material-eidetic spheres, one of them is marked out for us in such a manner that obviously there can be no thought of excluding it: the eidetic sphere pertaining to phenomenologically purified consciousness itself. Even if our aim were to study pure consciousness in its single particularizations, i.e., in the way proper to a science of matters of fact, though not as it is studied by empirical psychology (since we are operating within the limits imposed by our phenomenological exclusion of the world), we could not do without the Apriori belonging to consciousness. Ascience of matters offact cannot renounce the right to make use of the eidetic truths which relate to individual objectivities belonging to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its own</span><span class="font17"> province. But, according to what has already been said in the Introduction, our aim is</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">114</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">precisely to found phenomenology itself as an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic</span><span class="font17"> science, as the theory of the essence of transcendentally purified consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we do that, phenomenology embraces as its own all </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>cc</sup>immanental essences</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> i.e., all those which become singularized exclusively in the individual events ofa stream of consciousness, in fleeting single mental processes of any kind. Now it is of fundamental importance to see that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not all essences</span><span class="font17"> belong to that sphere, thatjust as in the case ofindividual objectivities the difference between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">immanental</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">transcendent</span><span class="font17"> objectivities obtains, so too it obtains in the case of the corresponding </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essences.</span><span class="font17"> Thus, for example, the essences &quot;physical thing,” &quot;spatial shape, <sup>t&lt;</sup>motion,^^ &quot;color of a physical thingZ</span><span class="font11"><sup>，</sup></span><span class="font17">and the like, and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">also</span><span class="font17"> the essences <sup>t4</sup>human being,” &quot;human sensation,&quot; &quot;psyche,&quot; &quot;psychical process&quot; (mental process in the psychological sense),<sup>4</sup>'person<sup>55</sup> ^character trait,&quot; and the like, are transcendent. If we intend to develop a phenomenology as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely descriptive eidetic doctrine ^ the immanental consciousness-formations,</span><span class="font17"> the occurrences in the stream of mental processes which can be seized upon within the boundaries drawn by phenomenological exclusion, then no transcendent individuals and, therefore, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">none of the <sup>Ci</sup>transcendent essences<sup>33</sup></span><span class="font17"> belonging within those</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">boundaries are included. These have their logical place in the eidetic doctrine of the relevant transcendent objectivities.<sup>18</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Concerned only with the immanental, phenomenology </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in no way posits the</span><span class="font17"> being ofsuch essences, makes no statements about their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">validity or nonvalidity,</span><span class="font17"> or about the ideal possibility ofobjectivities corresponding to them, and establishes no </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic laws</span><span class="font17"> relating to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Regions and disciplines concerning transcendent essences are essentially incapable of contributing any premises for a phenomenology which actually seeks to restrict itself to the region of pure mental processes. Since our aim is to ground phenomenology precisely in this purity (in conformity with the norm stated a moment ago), and since extremely great philosophical interests depend on its being developed with full awareness as havingsuch purity, we </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">explicitly broaden the original reduction</span><span class="font17"> to cover all provinces of transcendent essences and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ontologies</span><span class="font17"> pertaining to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus, just as we exclude actual physical Nature and the empirical natural sciences, we exclude the eidetic natural sciences, i.e., those which investigate<sup>19</sup> whatever essentially belongs to objectivity pertaining to physical nature as physical nature. Geometry, phoronomy, &lt;115&gt; and the &quot;pure” physics of matter, are parenthesized. In like manner, just as we have excluded all experiential sciences of animate natural beings and all empirical cultural sciences ofpersonal beings in personal associations, ofhuman beings as the subjects of history, the bearers of culture, and also such sciences of cultural formations themselves, etc., so now we also exclude the eidetic sciences corresponding to those objectivities. We exclude them before the fact and in idea; because up to now, as everyone knows, these<sup>20</sup> eidetic sciences (e.g., rational psychology and rational sociology) have not been founded or else have not been founded purely and in a manner free from objection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With respect to the philosophical functions which phenomenology is called upon to assume, it is well to state explicitly that our exposition has, at the same time, established the fact that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenology is absolutely independent of the material-eidetic sciences,</span><span class="font17"> as well as of all the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Our broadenings of the phenomenological reduction obviously do not have the fundamental significance which attaches to our original exclusion merely ot the natural world and the sciences relating to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This first reduction is, after all, what makes it at all possible in the first place to turn one's regard to the phenomenological field and seize upon its data. The other reductions, because they presuppose the first, are secondary; but this by no means implies that they have less significance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">§67 . </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Methodological Signification of the Systematic Theory of Phenomenological Reductions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">For the phenomenological method (and consequently for the method of any transcendental inquiry whatever) a systematic doctrine of all the phenomenological reductions which we have tried to outline here has a great importance. Their explicitly stated &quot;paren-thesizings^^ have the methodic function of continually reminding us that the spheres of being and cognition in question </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essentially</span><span class="font17"> lie outside the one which, as the transcendental phenomenological sphere, is to be explored, and that any intruding of premises belonging to those parenthesized spheres is an indication of countersensi-cal confusion, a genuine |ii£T613aoig. If the province of phenomenology were presented with such immediate obviousness as the province pertaining to the natural attitude in experiencing, or if it became &lt;&nbsp;116&gt; given in consequence of a simple transition from the latter to the eidetic attitude as, for example, the province of geometry becomes given when one starts from what is empirically spatial, then there would be no need of circumstantial reductions with the difficult deliberations which they involve. Nor would there be any need for care in distinguishing the separate steps were it not for the continuous temptations to fallacious </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Metabasis,</span><span class="font17"> particularly in the interpretation of the objectivies pertaining to the eidetic disciplines. They are such strong temptations that they threaten the person who, in so far as some single provinces are concerned, has freed himself from generally prevalent misconceptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the first place, there is the extraordinarily wide-spread inclination of our age to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">psychologize the eidetic.</span><span class="font17"> Its victims include many who call themselves idealists; indeed, the effect of all empiricistic conceptions on the idealistic camp has been a strong one. Anyone who regards ideas, essences, as &quot;psychical structures,<sup>,J</sup> anyone who, in the case of those operations of consciousness in which the &quot;concepts” of color, shape, etc., are attained on the basis of an exemplificatory</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">intuition of physical things with their colors, shapes, etc., confuses the resulting consciousness of these essences (color, shape) with the essences themselves, ascribing to the flux of consciousness as its really inherent component part something which necessarily transcends it: anyone who does this, on the one hand, corrupts psychology since it concerns even empirical consciousness; on the other hand (and this is what interests us here) it corrupts phenomenology. It is of very great importance, then, that clarity be produced in this respect if the region sought is to be actually found. This, however, is done naturally along the way which we have followed: first of all in a universal vindication of the eidetic as eidetic, and then in the context of the doctrine of the phenomenological reduction as involving a specific exclusion of the eidetic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now this exclusion, to be sure, had to be restricted to the eidetics of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">transcendent</span><span class="font17"> individual objectivities in every sense. Here a new fundamental moment is to be considered. Once we have freed ourselves from the inclination to psychologize the essence and the relationships among essences, it is another great step forward, one which by no means follows as a matter of course, when the highly significant distinction which we have designated briefly as the distinction between the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence of something immanent</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font7">炉 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">something transcendent</span><span class="font17"> is recognized and consistently taken into consideration throughout. On the one hand, essences of formations belonging to consciousness &lt;117&gt; itself; on the other hand, essences ofindividual affairs transcendent to consciousness, thus the essences of those individual affairs which only become &quot;manifested'' in formations belonging to consciousness, which become &quot;constituted&quot; in the manner peculiar to consciousness by virtue of sensuous appearances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At least for me the second step was very difficult, even after the first. Today that cannot escape an attentive reader of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen.</span><span class="font17"> With complete decisiveness the first step was taken there by grounding in detail the independent legitimacy of the eidetic in oposition to its being psychologized — much against the spirit of the times which was reacting so strongly against &quot;Platonism&quot; and &quot;logicism.&quot; As for the second step, it was decisively taken in some theories, for example, in those concerning logico-categorial objectivities and the presentive consciousness </span><span class="font7">炉</span><span class="font17">them; but in other expositions in the same volume the vacillation is obvious, e.g., in that the concept ofthe logical proposition is related sometimes to the logico-categorial objectivity and sometimes to the corresponding immanental essence</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">of the judgmental thinking. The fact is that the beginner in phenomenology finds it difficult to acquire a reflective mastery of the different focusings of consciousness with their different objective correlates. That, however, is true with respect to all eidetic spheres which do not pertain to the immanency of consciousness itself. One must gain this insight not only regarding formal-logical and formal-ontological essences and relationships among essences (thus in the case of essences such as &quot;proposition&quot; and &quot;synogism&quot; and, on the other hand, &quot;number,&quot; &quot;ordered set&quot; and &quot;manilbld&quot;), but also regarding essences drawn from the sphere of the natural world (like ''physical thing,&quot; &quot;bodily shape,&quot; &quot;human being,&quot; and &quot;person&quot;). An index to this insight is the broadened phenomenological reduction. Ruling us as a result is the practical consciousness that, as in the case of the sphere of the natural world, none of these eidetic spheres of essential necessity must be accepted by the phenomenologist as spheres given with respect to their veritable being; that, to ensure the purity of one<sup>5</sup>s region of inquiry, his judgments may refer to them only as parenthesized spheres; and that, from all the sciences pertaining to them, not a single theorem, indeed not even an axiom, can be taken and admitted as a premise for phenomenological purposes — all of this now acquires great methodological significance. Precisely by this &lt;practical consciousness&gt; we protect ourselves methodically against these confusions so deeply rooted in us as born dogmatists; in no other way could we avoid them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§62 . Epistemological Anticipations, The &quot;Dogmatic&quot; and the Phenomeno-</span><span class="font17"> &lt;118&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">logical Attitude.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">I just used the word &quot;dogmatist.&quot; It will become apparent that this was no merely analogical usage and that, on the contrary, the epistemological allusion has its source in the proper essence of the matters under consideration here. There is good reason for recalling here the epistemological antithesis between dogmatism and criticism and for calling all the sciences which have undergone reduction </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>(&lt;</sup> dogmatic:</span><span class="font17"> ^ For it can be seen, by virtue of the own peculiar essence of the sources, on the one hand, that they and they alone are the sciences which require </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^criticise</span><span class="font17"> — and, indeed, a criticism, which they themselves are essentially incapable of effecting; and, on the other hand, that the science having the unique function of effecting the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">criticism of all others and, at the same time, ofitselfis none other than phenomenology.<sup>21</sup> Stated more precisely: It is the distinctive peculiarity of phenomenology to embrace within the sphere of its eidetic universality all cognitions and sciences and, more particularly, with respect to everything in them which is an object of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">immediate insight,</span><span class="font17"> or at least would have to be such if they were genuine cognitions. The sense and legitimacy of all possible immediate starting-points and of all immediate steps in any possible method lie within its sphere of jurisdiction. Thus phenomenology includes all the eidetic (therefore unconditionally and universally valid) cognitions with which the radical problems of &quot;possibility&quot; relating to any alleged cognitions and sciences become solved. As applied phenomenology, of essential necessity it produces the ultimately evaluative criticism of each specifically peculiar science; and thus, in particular, it determines the ultimate sense of the &quot;being&quot; of its objects and the fundamental clarification of its methods. Accordingly, it is understandable that phenomenology is, so to speak, the secret nostalgia of all modern philosophy. The striving toward phenomenology was present already in the wonderfully profound Cartesian fundamental considerations; then, again, in the psychologism of the Lockean school; Hume almost set foot upon its domain, but with blinded eyes. And then the first to correctly see it was Kant, whose greatest intuitions become wholly understandable to us only when we had obtained by hard work a fully clear awareness of the peculiarity of the province </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">119</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">belonging to phenomenology. It then becomes evident to us that</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Kant's mental regard was resting on that field, although he was still unable to appropriate it or recognize it as a field of work pertaining to a strict eidetic science proper. Thus, for example, the transcendental deduction in the first edition of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Kritik der reinen Vernunft</span><span class="font17"> was actually operating inside the realm of phenomenology, but Kant misinterpreted that realm as psychological and therefore he himself abandoned it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But we are anticipating matters to be presented later (in the Third Book of this essay). Let the preliminary indications stated here serve to justify us in calling the complex»f sciences which undergo reduction &quot;dogmatic&quot; and in contrasting them with phenomenology as a science pertaining to a completely different dimension. At the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">same time we draw a parallel contrast between the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">dogmatic</span><span class="font17"> and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenological</span><span class="font17"> attitude. Obviously the natural attitude is then subordinate to the dogmatic attitude as a particularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Note</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The circumstance that the specifically phenomenological exclusions we have expounded are independent of the eidetic exclusion of individual existence suggests the question of whether, within the limits drawn by those exclusions, a factual science of transcendentally reduced mental processes is possible. This question, like every other question concerning fundamental essential possibilities, can be answered only within the realm of eidetic phenomenology. The answer is such that it becomes understandable why any attempt to start naively with a phenomenological science of matters of fact, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font17"> developing the phenomenological theory of essences, would be nonsense. For it is apparent that, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">alongside</span><span class="font17"> the extra-phenomenological sciences of matters of fact, there can be no phenomenological science of matters of fact as a science parallel to and co-ordinate with them. The reason for this is that the ultimate evaluation of all the sciences of matters of feet leads to a unitary link connecting the factual phenomenological contexts and the phenomenological contexts motivated as factual possibilities which correspond to all those sciences — a connected unity which is nothing else than the field belonging to the missing phenomenological sciences of matters of fact. A major part of this science is therefore a ^phenomenological conversion&quot; of the ordinary sciences of matters of fact which eidetic phenomenology makes possible; and the only remaining question is whether, starting from there, something more should be done.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">METHODS AND PROBLEMS OF PURE PHENOMENOLOGY</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">CHAPTER ONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">PRELIMINARY METHODIC DELIBERATIONS<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§63 . The Particular Significance of Methodic Deliberations for Phenomenology-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">If we heed the norms prescribed by the phenomenological reductions, if, as they demand, we exclude precisely all transcendencies and if, therefore, we take mental processes purely as they are with respect to their own essence, then, according to all that has been said, a field for eidetic cognitions is opened up to us. Once the initial difficulties have been overcome, it presents itself as infinite on every side. The multiplicity of kinds and forms of mental processes, with their really inherent and essential intentional constituents, is indeed inexhaustible as is, accordingly, the multiplicity of concatenations of essences and apodictically necessary truths based on &lt;those kinds and fbrms&gt;. This infinite field of the Apriori of consciousness which, in its peculiar ownness, has never received its due, indeed, has actually never been seen, must be brought under cultivation, then, and made to yield its fullest fruits. But how can we find the right beginning? As a matter of fact, the beginning is what is most difficult here, and the situation is unusual. The new field does not lie spread out before our view with a wealth of salient data in such a manner that we can simply reach out and be sure of the possibility of making them the objects of a science — to say nothing of being sure of the method by which we ought to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we attempt to increase our knowledge of them by investigative activities of our own, the situation here is not as it is in the case of what is given in the natural attitude, particularly in the case of objects belonging to Nature which, because of continuous experience and</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marginal note in Copy D to the first chapter:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Is not the first chapter dispensable? Its contents, however, should be taken into account and, in part, introduced into the exposition of phenomenology itself.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">ways of thinking which have been practised for centuries, are quite familiar to us with respect to manifold peculiarities, with respect to their elements and laws. Anything unknown there is a horizon of something known. Every methodic effort starts from something given; every further development of the method starts from the method already on hand; generally speaking, it is only a matter of developing special methods which fit into the already given and fixed style of a tested set of general scientific methods the discovery of which is guided by that style.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;121&gt; How different it is in phenomenology. It is not only that, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">prior</span><span class="font17"> to any method for determining matters within its field, a method is needed in order to bring, without exception, the field of affairs pertaining to transcendentally pure consciousness within the regard which seizes upon it; it is not only that this requires a difficult turning of the regard from the natural data which continue to be objects of consciousness and are thus, as it were, interwoven with the data newly intended to, so that the danger of confusing the two sets ofdata is always threatening; but it is also that everything helpful to us in the case of the natural sphere of objects is lacking: familiarity by virtue of long-practiced intuition, the benefit of inherited theorizations and methods adapted to the subject-matter. Obviously, even in the case of methods already developed there is lacking that comfortable confidence which would be nourished by a multiplicity of successful and confirmed applications in the accepted sciences and in the practice of daily life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">In making its first appearance phenomenology must therefore reckon with a fundamental mood of skepticism. It must not only develop the method for acquiring novel cognitions from the novel subject-matter; with respect to the sense and validity of that method it must produce the most perfect clarity so that it can meet every serious objection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In addition — and this, because it pertains to something essentially fundamental, is much more important — phenomenology, by virtue ofits essence, must claim to be “first'' philosophy and to offer the means for carrying out every possible critique of reason; therefore it demands the most perfect freedom from presuppositions and, concerning itselg an absolute reflective insight. It is ofits own essence to realize the most perfect clarity concerning its own essence and therefore also concerning the principles ofits method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For these reasons the painstaking efforts to acquire insight into the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">basic components of its method, into that which is methodically determinative for the new science from its very inception and continually throughout its progress, have a significance for phenomenology quite distinct from that which analogous efforts could ever have for other sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§ 64. The Phenomenologisf s Self-Exclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We must mention, first of all, a methodological objection which blocks even the first steps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We exclude the entire natural world and all transcendent-eidetic spheres; by so doing we should acquire a &quot;pure&quot; consciousness. But &lt;122&gt; have we not just said that '%e‘‘ exclude? </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Can</span><span class="font17"> we phenomenologists, who are indeed included among the members of the natural world, put </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ourselves</span><span class="font17"> out of action?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One is soon convinced that there is no difficulty whatever in so doing, provided that we have not shifted the sense of “excluding.&quot; We can even go on calmly speaking in the way we must as natural human beings; for as phenomenologists we are not supposed to stop being natural human beings or positing ourselves as such when we speak. But as a part of the method for ascertaining the truths which are to be entered in the registry book of phenomenology, which we are about to begin, we prescribe for ourselves the norm of phenomenological reduction which is concomitantly related to our empirical </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">factual being</span><span class="font17"> and prevents us from entering any proposition which contains, explicitly or implicitly, natural positions of that kind. In so far as it is a matter of individual factual being, the phenomenologists proceed like any other eidetic scientist, e.g., the geometer. In their scientific treatises geometers often speak of themselves and their research; but the mathematizing<sup>2</sup> subject is not included among the eidetic contents of mathematical propositions themselves.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§65 . The Reflexive Reference of Phenomenology to Itself.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Again, it might be found objectionable that in the phenomenological attitude we direct our regard to some pure mental processes or other</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">in order to explore them, but that the mental processes of this research itself with this attitude and line of vision, should, when taken in phenomenological purity at the same time belong to the realm to be explored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Here, too, there is no difficulty. The situation is precisely similar in psychology and likewise in logical noetics. The thinking of the psychologist is itself something psychological; the thinking of the logician is something logical, i.e., something which lies within the realm to which the norms of logic apply. This reflexive reference to themselves would be of concern only if the phenomenological, psychological, or logical cognition of the thinking currently done by the particular thinker were a condition on which the cognition of all the other things in the respective provinces of research would depend. But that is an obviously absurd proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Admittedly, a certain difficulty is involved in all disciplines reflexively related to themselves, in that the first introduction to them, as &lt;123&gt; well as the first investigative penetration into them, must operate with methodic resources to which &lt;the discipline in question&gt; can only subsequently give a scientifically definitive form. Without preliminary and preparatory deliberations on its subject-matter and method, no new science could ever be projected. But the concepts and the other elements of method with which an incipient psychology or phenomenology operates in such preparatory efforts are themselves psychological or phenomenological and acquire their scientific stamp only within the system of the science after the latter has already been legitimated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Obviously no serious objections which could hinder the actual development ofsuch sciences, particularly phenomenology, are to be found along the way. If phenomenology, then, is to be entirely a science </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">within the limits of mere immediate Intuition</span><span class="font17"> a purely </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>((</sup>descriptive^ </span><span class="font17">eidetic science, then what is universal ofits procedure is already given as something obvious. It must expose to its view events of pure consciousness as examples &lt;and&gt; make them perfectly clear; within the limits of this clarity it must analyze and seize upon their essences, trace with insight the essential interconnections, formulate what is beheld in faithful conceptual expressions which allow their sense to be prescribed purely by what is beheld or generically seen; and so forth. This procedure, followed naively, serves at first only for the sake of looking about in the new province, acquiring some general practice in seeing, seizing upon and analyzing in it and becoming</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">somewhat familiar with its data. Then scientific reflection on the essence of the procedure itself on the essence of the modes of givenness functioning in it, on the essence, the effect, the conditions of perfect clarity and insight as well as of perfectly faithful and fixed conceptual expression, and on other such things, now takes on the function of a generical and logically rigorous grounding of the method. Consciously followed, it now assumes the characteristic and rank of a scientific method which, in any given case, allows for practicing a limiting and improving criticism by applying the strictly formulated norms of method. Here the essential relatedness of phenomenology to itself becomes manifest in that what reflection on the method examines and ascertains under the headings of clarity, insight, expression, and the like, is, on its side, itself included in the domain of phenomenology and that all the reflective analyses which are phenomenological analyses of essences and the acquired methodological insights, with respect to what they ascertain, must square with the norms which they formulate. Therefore one must be able to</span><span class="font7">〈 </span><span class="font17">124&gt; persuade oneself at any time, by new reflections, that the predicative-ly formed affair-complexes asserted in the methodological statements can be given with perfect clarity, that the concepts used actually conform faithfully to what is given, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What has just been said obviously holds for all methodological investigations relating to phenomenology, no matter how far we might extend their limits; we therefore understand that this whole essay, which aims at preparing the way for phenomenology, is itself phenomenology throughout.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§66 . Faithful Expression of Clear Data. Unambiguous Terms.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Let us directly follow a bit further the most universal methodological thoughts which have come out in the previous sections. In phenomenology, then, which is to be nothing else but a theory of essences &lt;produced&gt; within pure intuition, we perform acts of seeing essences immediately in given examples of transcendentally pure consciousness and fix them </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">conceptually</span><span class="font17"> and terminologically. The words used may derive from the common language; they may be ambiguous and their changing senses may be vague. As soon as they &quot;coincide&quot; with the intuitionally given in the manner characteristic of an actual expression, they take on a definite sense as their actually present and</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">clear sense, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">hie et nunc;</span><span class="font17"> and starting from there we can fix them scientifically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To be sure, not everything has been done in merely applying the word in faithful conformity to the essence seized upon intuitionally, even though everything necessary may have been carried out in so far as this intuitive seizing-upon is concerned. Science is possible only where the results of thinking can be stored up in the form of knowledge and used for later thinking in the form of a system of statements which are distinct in their logical sense and can be understood or actualized in a judging, but without clearness in the underlying objectivatings and therefore without insight. Of course, &lt;science&gt; requires at the same time subjectivesand objective provisions for the reproducing at will (and, more particularly, intersubjectively) the relevant groundings and actual insights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">All of that, now, requires that the same words and sentences preserve an unambiguous coordination with certain intuitionally apprehensible essences which make up their ^fulfilling sense.<sup>,s</sup> On the ground, then, of eidetic intuition and thoroughly practised intuitions &lt;125&gt; of single examples they are furnished with distinct and single significations (the other significations which occasionally emerge by force of habit being, as it were, &quot;cancelled”</span><span class="font11">)</span><span class="font17">in such a manner that, in all possible concatenations of actually present thinking, they keep their concepts produced by thinking and lose their capacity of conforming to other intuitional data with other fulfilling essences. Since, for good reasons in view of the existing ambiguities of common usage, foreign technical terms should, in so far as possible, be avoided in the generally accepted language, there is a continuing need for caution and for frequent re-examination to see whether what was fixed in the earlier context is actually employed in the same sense in the new one. But this is not the place for going more precisely into these and similar rules (including, e.g., those relating to science as a product of inter-subjective collaboration).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">§67 . </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Method of Clarification.<sup>3 cc</sup>Nearness of Givenness<sup>33</sup> and <sup>cc</sup>Remoteness of Givenness/^</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Of greater interest to us are methodological deliberations relating, not to expression, but to the essences and essential concatenations to be expressed by it and to be seized upon prior &lt;to being expressed&gt;. If our inquiring regard is directed to mental processes they will generally offer themselves with an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">emptiness</span><span class="font17"> and a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">vague remoteness</span><span class="font17"> which make them useless for either single or eidetic findings. The situation would be different if^ instead of those mental processes themselves, we were interested in their mode of givenness and ifwe wished to explore the essence of emptiness or vagueness itself which, for their part, become given in such cases with the fullest clarity rather than vaguely. But if something itself vaguely intended to, e.g., the obscurely hovering object of memory or phantasy, is asked to deliver up its essence, then what it delivers up will have to be something imperfect; that is, where those </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intuitions &quot;single particulars</span><span class="font17"> which are the basis for seizing upon an essence have a low degree of clarity, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">seizings upon the essence </span><span class="font17">likewise &lt;have a low degree of clarity&gt;; and, correlatively, what is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">seized upon</span><span class="font17"> is, in respect of its sense, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>cc</sup>unclear:&quot;<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font17"> it is hazy, undecisively separated both internally and externally. One cannot decide, or can decide &quot;only roughly,<sup>5,</sup> whether what is seized upon here and what is seized upon there as the same (or the same essence); one cannot ascertain what components are actually included in it, or what those components &quot;really are&quot; which perhaps are already shown by vague contrast or are indicated in a wavering fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">That which floats before us in fluid unclarity, with a greater or less </span><span class="font7">〈 </span><span class="font17">126</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">intuitional remoteness, must therefore be brought into normal nearness and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">made perfectly clear</span><span class="font17"> before it can be used as the basis for a correspondingly valuable eidetic intuition in which the essences and eidetic relationships intended to attain perfect givenness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus the seizing upon essences itself has its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">degrees cf clarity,</span><span class="font17"> as does the single particular floating before us. However, just as there is for the moment corresponding to it in the individual, there is for any essence an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">absolute nearness^</span><span class="font17"> so to speak, in which its givenness, compared to the series of degrees of clarity, in an absolute — i.e., a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure </span><span class="font17">givenness ofit itself. We are aware of what is objective </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[das Gegenstand-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Uche &lt;scl.</span><span class="font17"> either the objective essence or the individuab] not merely somehow or other as &quot;it itself<sup>5</sup> standing in view and as <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>given,^^ but as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely</span><span class="font17"> given something itself, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">completely and precisely as it is in itself. </span><span class="font17">In so far as a residue of unclarity remains, it casts a shadow over certain moments in that which is ''itself<sup>5</sup> given and, accordingly, those moments remain outside the circle of light suffusing the purely given. In the case of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">complete unclarity^</span><span class="font17"> the polar opposite to complete clarity, nothing at all has become given; the consciousness is &quot;blind J is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">no longer in the least intuitive,</span><span class="font17"> is not at all a <sup>t&lt;</sup>presentive^^ consciousness in the proper sense.<sup>5</sup> As a consequence, we have to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">A presentive consciousness in the pregnant sense</span><span class="font17"> and an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intuitive</span><span class="font17"> consciousness in contradistinction to a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">non-intuitive</span><span class="font17"> consciousness, a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">clear</span><span class="font17"> consciousness in contradistinction to an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unclear</span><span class="font17"> one: these coincide. The same holds for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">degrees of givenness,</span><span class="font17"> of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intuitedness,</span><span class="font17"> and of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">clarity.</span><span class="font17"> The zero-limit is complete obscurity; the limit, one, is complete clarity, intuitedness, givenness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this context, however, givenness must not be understood as originary givenness and therefore not as perceptual. We do not identify what is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>&lt;e</sup>given as it itself&quot;</span><span class="font17"> with what is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^given originarily/<sup>3 &lt;e</sup>given in person/<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font17"> In the definitely characterized sense</span><span class="font7">「</span><span class="font17">given&quot; and &quot;given as it itself<sup>5</sup> are the same; and our employment of the redundant expression serves only to exclude ^z </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">venness in the broader sense</span><span class="font17"> in which it is said, ultimately, concerning anything objectively intended to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[je-dem Vorstelligen]</span><span class="font17"> that it is given in the intending to it [ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Vorstellung] </span><span class="font17">(though perhaps in an &quot;empty manner<sup>,,</sup>).<sup>e</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As can be seen immediately, our definitions apply moreover </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">to any </span><span class="font17">intuitions and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">empty</span><span class="font17"> objectivatings </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Leervorstellungen]</span><span class="font17">, and therefore </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">without any restriction with respect to the objectivities^</span><span class="font17"> although we are </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">127</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">interested here only in the manners in which mental processes and their phenomenological (really inherent and intentive) components are given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But in consideration of future analyses, it should be also noted that the most essential part of the situation remains: whether or not the regard of the pure Ego goes through the mental processes in question; stated more precisely, whether or not the pure Ego </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^adverts to<sup>&gt;3</sup></span><span class="font17"> a</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;datum&quot; and perchance </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>ci</sup>seizes upon&quot;</span><span class="font17"> it. Accordingly, for example, &quot;perceptually given&quot; — instead ofbeing tantamount to &quot;perceived&quot; in the proper and normal sense of seizing upon this datum in its being —-can signify merely &quot;ready for perception?<sup>5</sup> In like manner, <sup>4t</sup>given in the mode characteristic of phantasy<sup>?,</sup> need not signify &quot;seized upon in a phantasying;<sup>?,</sup> and the like is true universally and with respect to all degrees of clarity or obscurity. We refer in advance to &quot;readiness,&quot; which is to be discussed in detail later on, and wish to say at the same time that where nothing to the contrary is added or obvious from the context, under the heading of <sup>tt</sup>givenness<sup>,5</sup> we </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">also understand being seized upon</span><span class="font17"> and, in the case of givenness of an essence, being seized upon originarily.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§68 . Genuine and Spurious Degrees &quot;&nbsp;Clarity, The Essence &quot;&nbsp;Normal Clarification.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">But we must still continue our descriptions. If we speak of degrees of givenness or clarity, we must distinguish between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">genuine</span><span class="font17"> graded degrees of clarity, with which one may include, in the same series, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">graded degrees of obscurity;</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">spurious degrees &quot;&nbsp;clarity^</span><span class="font17"> namely </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">extensive broadenings &quot;&nbsp;the sphere of clarity,</span><span class="font17"> perhaps with a simultaneous intensive enhancement of clarity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An already given, already actually intuited moment, e.g., a tone or a color, can be given with greater or less clarity. Let us exclude all apprehendings which reach out beyond what is given intuitionally. We are dealing then with a number of graded degrees which occur inside the limits within which the intuited moment is indeed actually intuited; intuitedness as intuitedness admits of continuous intensitylike differences under the heading of clarity which, like intensities, begin with zero but end with a fixed upper limit. One might say that the lower degrees indicate the latter in a certain fashion; intuiting a color in a mode bf imperfect clarity, we &quot;mean&quot; the color as it is &quot;in itself' — i.e., precisely the color given with perfect clarity. Nevertheless one must not let oneself be misled by the metaphor of indicating</span><span class="font7">〈 </span><span class="font17">128&gt; —as though one thing were a sign of another; nor may one speak here (we recall something noted once before)<sup>8</sup> of a presentation of the &quot;In itself' by virtue of the unclear, somewhat as a physical property</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">author's footnote:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> cf. above, §44, p. 83.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">becomes <sup>44</sup>presented,<sup>?,</sup> i.e., adumbrated, in intuition by virtue of a moment belonging to sensation. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Graded differences in clarity are exclusively differences of a peculiar kind in the mode of givenness.<sup>9</sup> *</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The situation is quite different where an apprehending which reaches </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">out beyond</span><span class="font17"> the intuitionally given interweaves empty appre-hendings with the actually intuitive apprehendings so that, in a quasi-graded fashion,</span><span class="font7">加</span><span class="font17">o</span><span class="font11">，</span><span class="font17">eofwhat is emptily intended to can become intuited and, conversely, more of what is already intuited can become emptily intended to. Accordingly, in this case </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">making something clear to oneself</span><span class="font17"> consists of processes of two kinds which combine with one another: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">processes of actualizing intuition</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">processes of enhancing the clarity of what is already intuited.<sup>lQ</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But that is a description of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence of normal clarification.</span><span class="font17"> For, as a rule, it is not the case that pure intuitions are present or that pure empty intendings turn into pure intuitions; rather it is normally the case that, perhaps as intermediate stages, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">impure intuitions</span><span class="font17"> play a major role, &lt;intuitions&gt; which make their objects intuited with respect to certain sides or moments, but intend to them only emptily with respect to others.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§69 . The Method of Perfectly Clear Seizing Upon Essences.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">In consequence ofits </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^^ncc,perfectly clear seizing-upon</span><span class="font17"> has the advantage that it allows for an absolutely certain identifying and distinguishing, explicating, relating, and so forth, thus allowing for effectingall &quot;logical&quot; acts &quot;with insight.&quot; The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">acts ofseizing upon essences</span><span class="font17"> also belong among these acts to the correlates of which, as already said above, the differences in clarity, to be spelled out now in greater detail, are transferred just as, on the other hand, the methodological cognitions wejust now acquired are transferred to the attainment of a perfect givenness of essences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus the method, which is a</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fundamental part of the method of all eidetic science,</span><span class="font17"> universally requires proceeding step by step. The intuitions of single particulars serving the seizing upon essences may be already clear to an extent which allows for acquiring an essentially universal </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">129</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">moment which, however, does not extend as far as the guiding</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">intention; clarity is lacking on the side pertaining to more detailed determinations of the essences combined with &lt;what had been attained &gt;, consequently there is a need to bring the exemplificatory single particulars nearer or to provide anew more suitable ones in which the confusedly and obscurely single traits intended to stand out and, consequently, can become given with maximum clarity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A bringing nearer is effected here throughout, even </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the sphere of obscurity.</span><span class="font17"> What is obscurely intended to comes closer to us in its own manner; finally it knocks at the door of intuition, but even so it need not come in (and perhaps it cannot &quot;because of psychological obstructions”</span><span class="font11">)</span><span class="font17">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It should also be mentioned that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">what is given at any particular time is usually surrounded by </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> halo of undetermined determinability,</span><span class="font17"> which has its mode of being brought closer </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>ii</sup>explicatively<sup>,3</sup></span><span class="font17"> in becoming separated into a number of in tendings </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Vorstellungen];</span><span class="font17"> at first it still may be in the realm of obscurity, but then within the sphere of givenness until what is intended to comes into the sharply illuminated circle of perfect givenness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Attention should also be called to the fact that it would doubtless be too much to say that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all evidence in seizing upon essences requires </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> complete clarity of the underlying single particulars in their concreteness.</span><span class="font17"> To seize upon the most universal eidetic differences, like those between color and sound and between perception and will, it is doubtless sufficient that the examples be given with a low degree of clarity. It is as though the most universal, the genus (color taken universally, sound taken universally) were given </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">completely</span><span class="font17"> but not as yet the differentia. The phraseology is objectionable, but I see no way of avoiding it. Let the reader make the situtation present to himself in living intuition.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§70 . The Role of Perception in the Method of Eidetic Clarification. The Primacy of Free Phantasy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Let us bring out a few especially important features of the method followed in seizing upon essences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is of the universal essence of the immediately intuitive seizing upon essences that (as we have already emphasized<sup>11</sup>) it can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">effected on the ground of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mere presentiation</span><span class="font17"> of exemplificative single particulars. Presentiation, e.g., phantasy, however, as we have just &lt;130&gt; explained, can be so perfectly clear that it makes possible a perfect seizing upon essences and a perfect eidetic insight. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Originarily presentive perception</span><span class="font17"> in general and, of course, external perception in particular, has its primacies over all kinds of presentiation not merely as an experiencing act for findings about factual being (which, after all, do not concern us here), but also as a foundation for phenomenological eidetic findings. External perception has its perfect clarity with respect to all the objective moments actually given in it in the mode of originariness.<sup>12</sup> But it also offers, perhaps with the cooperation of reflection related back to it, clear and steady singularizations for universal eidetic analyses of a phenomenological kind, more precisely even for act-analyses. Anger may be evaporated, its content may be quickly modified by reflection. Nor is it always available like perception, producible at any time by easy experimental arrangements. To study it reflectively in its originariness is to study an evaporating anger which, to be sure, is by no means insignificant but may not be what ought to be studied. In contrast, external perception, which is so much more accessible, is not &quot;evaporated&quot; by reflection; its universal essence and the essence of its components and essential correlates universally belonging to it can be studied within the limits of originariness without particular efforts to produce clarity.<sup>13</sup> If it be said that perception also has its differences in clarity, namely with reference to cases of perception in the dark, in a fog, etc., we do not wish to become involved in more precise deliberations about whether or not these differences should be placed on a par with those already discussed. It is sufficient that perception is not normally beclouded and that clear perception is always at our disposal when we need it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If the primacies of originariness were very important for our method we should now have to consider where, how, and to what extent they are realizable in the various kinds of mental processes, which kinds of mental processes come especially close in this respect to the privileged sphere of sense perception, and many other similar questions. But all that may be disregarded. There are reasons by virtue of which in phenomenology, as in all other eidetic sciences, presentiations and, more precisely,y?^</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phantasies</span><span class="font17"> acquire </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">position of</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">primacy over perceptions</span><span class="font17"> and do so </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">even in the phenomenology of perception</span><span class="font17"> &lt;131&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">itself excluding, to be sure, the phenomenology of the Data &quot;sensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In his investigative thinking the geometer operates on the figure or model incomparably more in phantasy than in perception, and even more so does the &quot;pure&quot; geometer, i.e., the one who dispenses with algebraic methods. In phantasy, to be sure, he must make an effort to attain clear intuitions from which he is exempted by the sketch or model. But in actually sketching and constructing a model he is restricted; in phantasy he has incomparably more freedom reshaping at will the figures feigned, and in running through continuously modified possible shapings, thus in generating an immense number of new formations; a freedom opens up to him for the very first time an access to the expanses of essential possibilities with their infinite horizons of eidetic cognitions. For that reason the sketches normally come </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font17"> the phantasy-constructions and the eidetically pure thinking done on the basis of the latter and serve chiefly to fix certain stages in the previously performed process, thereby making it easier to presentiate again. Even where one &quot;ponders&quot; while looking at the figure, the processes of thinking which follow are, with respect to their sensuous substratum, processes of phantasy the results of which fix the new lines in the figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In its most universal features, the situation is no different for the phenomenologist who deals with reduced mental processes and their eidetically necessary correlates. There are also infinitely many eidetic phenomenological formations. He too can use the resource of originary givenness only to a limited extent. To be sure, in the mode of originary givenness he has at his free disposal all the chief types of perceptions and presentiations as perceivable exemplifications for a phenomenology of perception, phantasy, memory, etc. In so far as the most universal essences are concerned, in the sphere of originari-ness he has at his command in the same way examples of judgings, deemings likely, feelings, and willings. However, of course &lt;he does not have examples&gt; for all possible particular formations any more than the geometer has sketches or models at his disposal for the infinitely many kinds of solids. Here, in any case, the freedom of eidetic research also necessarily demands operating in phantasy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">While on the other hand (and, again, as in geometry which not without reason has recently attached great value to collections of models and the like), naturally, it is necessary to exercise one's &lt;132&gt; phantasy abundantly in the required activity of perfect clarification</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">and in the free reshaping of phantasy-data, it is also necessary, before doing that, to fertilize one's phantasy by observations in originary intuition which are as abundant and excellent as possible: whereby this is not to say that experience as experience has here a function in grounding validity. Extraordinary profit can be drawn from the offerings of history, in even more abundant measure from those of art, and especially from poetry, which are, to be sure, imaginary but which, in the originality of their invention of forms </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[NeugestaUungen], </span><span class="font17">the abundance of their single features and the unbrokenness of their motivation, tower high above the products of our own phantasy and, in addition, when they are apprehended understandingly, become converted into perfectly clear phantasies with particular ease owing to the suggestive power exerted by artistic means of presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus if one is fond of paradoxical phrases, one can actually say, and if one means the ambiguous phrase in the right sense, one can say in strict truth, that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;jeigning&quot; [Fiktion<sup>33</sup>] makes up the vital element of phenomenology as &quot;every other eidetic science,</span><span class="font17"> that feigning is the source from which the cognition of &quot;eternal truths&quot; is fed.<sup>14</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§71 . The Problem of the Possibility of</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Descriptive Eidetics of Mental Processes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Repeatedly in the foregoing we have characterized phenomenology simply as a descriptive science. There again a fundamental question of method arises, and a consideration which checks us, eager though we may be to penetrate the new province. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Is it correct to set for phenomenology the tasks of mere description? A descriptive eidetics</span><span class="font17">—is that not </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">something altogether wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The motives for such questions are sufficiently obvious in all of us. Anyone who in our fashion is, so to speak, feeling his way into a new eidetics, asking what kind ofinquiries are possible here, what starting points should be taken and what methods should be followed, looks involuntarily at the old highly developed eidetic disciplines, thus at the mathematical disciplines, especially geometry and arithmetic. We note immediately, however, that these disciplines cannot be called upon to offer guidance in our case, that in them the relations</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">“author's footnote:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> A sentence which, as a quotation, should be especially suitable for a naturalistic ridiculing of the eidetic mode of cognition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">must be essentially different. For the person who has not yet become &lt;133&gt; acquainted with any piece of genuine phenomenological eidetic analysis there is some danger here of becoming puzzled about the possibility of a phenomenology. Since the mathematical disciplines are the only ones which can at present represent in an effective manner the idea of a scientific eidetics, he will at first be far from thinking that there could be eidetic disciplines of another kind, non-mathematical eidetic disciplines fundamentally different from the familiar eidetic disciplines in their whole theoretical kind. Therefore if he has let himself be won over by general considerations to the belief that a phenomenological eidetics is required, the immediately abortive attempt to establish anything like a mathematics of phenomena can mislead him into a relinquishing of the idea of a phenomenology. But that would really be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us make clear to ourselves the most universal </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">peculiarities of mathematical disciplines as contrasted with those of an eidetic theory &quot;&nbsp;mental processes,</span><span class="font17"> and let us therefore make clear what those aims and methods really are which, as we have suggested, are essentially inappropriate to the sphere of mental processes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§72 . Eidetic Sciences: Concrete, Abstract, ^Mathematical,&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">We start from the division of essences and eidetic sciences into material and formal. The formal ones we can eliminate (thereby eliminating the whole set of formal mathematical disciplines), since phenomenology obviously belongs among the material eidetic sciences. If analogy can be any guide to method, it will act most powerfully if we restrict ourselves to material mathematical disciplines like, for example, geometry and accordingly ask more specifically whether a phenomenology must be, or can be, constituted as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>ct</sup>geometry&quot; of mental processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To acquire the Insight desired here, it is necessary to bear in mind some important findings which belong to the general theory of science.<sup>15</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Any theoretical science unites an ideally closed totality by reference to a province ofknowledge which, for its part, is determined by a</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">i'author'sfootnote:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Inconnectionwith the further exposition, cf. above Part One, Chapter One, especially §§12, 15 and 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">134&gt; higher genus. A radical unity is attained only when we go back to the absolutely highest genus, i.e., when we go back to the particular region and to the components of the regional genus, i.e., to the highest genera united in the regional genus, genera which may be based one upon another. The structure of the highest concrete gends (the region), made up in part of discrete highest genera and in part of highest genera founded one upon another (and, in this fashion, embracing one another), corresponds to the structure of the subordinate concreta made up in part of discrete lowest species and in part of lowest species founded one upon the other; for example, in the case of the physical thing, temporal determinateness, spatial determinateness and material determinateness. To each region there corresponds a regional ontology which comprises a number of regional sciences either self-sufficiently closed or perhaps based one upon another, corresponding precisely to the highest genera which are united in making up the region. To subordinate genera mere disciplines or so-called theories correspond — e.g., the discipline pertaining to conic sections corresponds to the genus </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">conic section.</span><span class="font17"> In conceptual terms, such a discipline has no complete self-sufficiency, since in its cognitions and in their cognitive groundings it naturally must have at its disposal the entire foundation of eidetic cognitions which derives its unity from the highest genus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In accordance with whether the highest genera are regional (concrete) or merely components of regional genera, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sciences are either concrete or abstract.</span><span class="font17"> The distinction obviously corresponds to the universal distinction between concrete and abstract genera.<sup>16</sup> Consequently the province is made up either of concrete objects (as in the case of the eidetics of Nature) or else of abstract objects (such as spatial shapes, temporal shapes, or the shapes of movements). The essential relationship of all abstract genera to concrete and ultimately to regional genera gives to all abstract disciplines and complete abstract sciences an essential relationship to concrete sciences and &lt;ultimately&gt; to the regional sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The division of eidetic sciences has its exact parallel, moreover, in a division of the experiential sciences. They too are distinguished from one another with respect to the regions. We have, for example, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font17">physical science of Nature; and all the single sciences ofNature are properly mere disciplines: the potent set of laws, not only eidetic but</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">author's footnote:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cf. above, §15, pp. 30f</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">also empirical, which pertain to Nature as a whole prior to any separation into spheres of Nature, gives them unity. In addition, different regions can prove to be interconnected by empirical laws, as for example the region of the physical and the region of the psychical. &lt;135&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Ifwe look now at the familiar eidetic sciences, we are struck by the fact that their procedure is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not descriptive,</span><span class="font17"> that, e.g., the lowest eidetic species, that is to say, the countless spatial shapes which can be drawn in space, are not seized upon in intuitions of single particulars, described and ordered into classes by geometry, as do the empirical sciences ofNature with respect to the empirical formations ofNature. On the contrary, geometry fixes a few kinds of fundamental structures, the ideas of solid, plane, point, angle, and the like, the ones which play the determining role in the &quot;axioms.&quot; With the help of the axioms, i.e., the primitive eidetic laws, it is then in a position to derive purely deductively </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> the spatial shapes &quot;existing J that is, ideally possible &lt;shapes&gt;, in space and all the eidetic relationships pertaining to those shapes in the form of exactly determining concepts which take the place of the essences which, as a rule, remain foreign to our intuition. The generic essence of the province of geometry, or the pure essence of space, is of such a character that geometry can be completely certain of dominating actually by its method all the possibilities and of determining them exactly. In other words, the multiplicity comprising all spatial formations has a remarkable fundamental logical property, indicated in the names, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^definite manifold” </span><span class="font17">and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^mathematical manifold in the pregnant sense&quot;'</span><span class="font17"> which we hereby introduce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Such a manifold is characterized by the fact that a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">finite number of concepts and propositions</span><span class="font17"> derivable in a given case from the essence of the province in question, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the manner characteristic of purely analytic necessity completely and unambiguously determines to totality of all the possible formations belonging to the province</span><span class="font17"> so that, / </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essential necessity, nothing in the province is left open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We can also say that such a manifold has the distinctive property of being </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>C(</sup>mathematically-exhaustively definable.<sup>33</sup></span><span class="font17"> The &quot;definition'' consists of the system of axiomatic concepts and axioms; and the &quot;mathematically exhaustive&quot; consists of the fact that the defining assertions involve the greatest conceivable prejudgment </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">\Prajudiz\</span><span class="font17"> concerning the manifold: nothing remains undetermined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An equivalent of the concept of a definite manifold is contained in the following propositions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Any proposition which can be constructed out of the distinctive </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">136</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">axiomatic concepts, regardless of its logical form, is either a pure formal-logical consequence of the axioms or else a pure formal-logical anti-consequence — that is to say, a proposition formally contradicting the axioms, so that its contradictory opposite would be a formal-logical consequence of the axioms. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">In the case of a mathematically definite manifold the concepts</span><span class="font17"> “&quot;</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">e&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">and<sup>cc</sup>formal-logical consequence</span><span class="font7"> 炉 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the axioms<sup>33</sup> are equivalent;</span><span class="font17"> and so are the concepts &quot;false'' and <sup>4</sup>'formal-logical anti-consequence of the axioms.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A system of axioms which, in the manner indicated, ''exhaustively defines^ a manifold purely analytically is what I call also a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">definite system cf axioms.</span><span class="font17"> Any deductive discipline based on such a system is a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">definite discipline</span><span class="font17"> or, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the pregnant sense,</span><span class="font17"> one which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mathematical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The definitions continue to exist collectively if we let the material particularization of the manifold become completely undetermined —that is to say, if we undertake formalizing universalization. The system of axioms then changes into a system of forms of axioms; the manifold, into a form of manifolds; and the discipline, into a discipline-form.<sup>17</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17">What can be said, then, about </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenology</span><span class="font17"> in comparison with geometry as a representative ofall material mathematics? It is clear that phenomenology belongs among the concrete-eidetic disciplines.

(Cf. the brief reference, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen,</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Vol. I<sup>1</sup>, p. 250 &lt;English translation, p. 242&gt;.) Since then I have often had occasion to develop the relevant concepts and theories in lectures and seminars, partly in complete detail; and in the winter semester of 1901/02 </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[reading with Schuhmann<sub>y</sub> instead of 1900101 as in the three printed editions]</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> I dealt with them in a double lecture to the Gottingen Mathematical Society. Some parts of this train of thoughts have found their way into the literature, without mention of their original sources.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The close relationship of the concept of definiteness to the &quot;axiom of completeness'' introduced by Hilbert for the foundation of arithmetic will be immediately obvious to every mathematician.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">abstract moments of many kinds; and the question now is: Do the highest genera pertaining to those abstract moments form provinces here for definite disciplines, &quot;mathematical&quot; disciplines after the manner of geometry? Must we accordingly look for a definite system &lt;137&gt; of axioms here and erect a deductive system upon it? Correlatively, must we look for ''fundamental fbrmations&quot; here, and from them derive by construction, i.e., deductively by a consequential application of the axioms, all the other essential formations in the province and their essential determinations? But involved in the essence of such a deriving, and this must also be noted, is that it is a mediate logical determining the results of which, even if they are &quot;drawn in the figure/<sup>5</sup> are of essential necessity incapable of being seized upon in immediate intuition. We can frame a correlative version of our question in these words: Is the stream of consciousness a genuine mathematical manifold? Taken in its factualness, is it like Nature, the Nature which physics is about, which indeed, if the ideal which guides the physicist is valid, and strictly conceived, must be characterized as a concrete definite manifold?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A highly significant problem pertaining to the theory of science is that of becoming completely clear about all the relevant essential questions involved here; thus after the concept of the definite manifold has been fixed, there is &lt;the problem&gt; of examining the conditions which a materially determined province must satisfy if it is to correspond to that idea. One necessary condition is exactness in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^concept-formation^</span><span class="font17"> which is by no means a matter of free choice and logical technique; rather, in the case of the supposedly axiomatic concepts which, after all, must be demonstrable in immediate intuition, it presupposes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">exactness in the essences themselves which are seized upon.</span><span class="font17"> But the extent to which &quot;exact&quot; essences can be found in a particular eidetic province, and whether exact essences can be seized upon in actual intuition as substructing </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> essences and accordingly as sub-structing all their eidetic components too, are matters depending entirely on the peculiar nature of the province in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The problem just mentioned is intimately related to the fundamental and still unsolved problems pertaining to an essentially necessary clarification of the relationship between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^description^</span><span class="font17"> with its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^descriptive concepts^</span><span class="font17"> and ''unambiguous determination&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">or &quot;exact determination^</span><span class="font17"> with its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^ideal concepts&quot;,</span><span class="font17"> and, parallel with that, a clarification of the so-little understood relationship between &quot;des</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> criptive&quot; and <sup>&lt;t</sup>explanato^y^^ sciences. An attempt to deal with these</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">problems will be communicated in the sequel to these investigations. Here the interruption of the main trend of our deliberations must not &lt;138&gt; be unduly prolonged; nor has our preparation been sufficient to enable us to treat such questions exhaustively. In what follows here it will be enough if we indicate in a general fashion some points deserving our consideration.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§74 . Descriptive and Exact Sciences.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Let us connect our considerations to the contrast between geometry and descriptive natural science. The geometer is not interested in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font17"> sensuously intuitable shapes, as the descriptive natural scientist is. He does not, like the latter, fashion </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">morphological concepts</span><span class="font17"> of vague configurational types which are directly seized upon on the basis of sensuous intuition and which, in their vagueness, become conceptually and terminologically fixed. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">vagueness</span><span class="font17"> of such concepts, the circumstance that their spheres of application are fluid, does not make them defective; for in the spheres of knowledge where they are used they are absolutely indispensable, or in those spheres they are the only legitimate concepts. If the aim is to give appropriate conceptual expression to the intuitionally given essential characteristics of intuitionally given physical things, that means precisely that the latter must be taken as they are given. And they are given precisely as fluid; and typical essences can become seized upon as exemplified in them only in immediately analytic eidetic intuition. The most perfect geometry and the most perfect practical mastery of it cannot enable the descriptive natural scientist to express (in exact geometrical concepts) what he expresses in such a simple, understandable, and completely appropriate manner by the words &quot;notches,'' &quot;seal-loped,<sup>M</sup> ^lens-shaped,<sup>M &lt;^</sup>umbellifb^m,^^ and the like -— all to them concepts which are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essentially, rather than accidentally, inexact</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consequently</span><span class="font17"> also non-mathematical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Geometrical concepts are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;ideal&quot; concepts,</span><span class="font17"> expressing something which cannot be &quot;seen” their &quot;origin&quot; and therefore their content are essentially other than those of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">descriptive concepts',</span><span class="font17"> as concepts they express, not &quot;ideals J but essences drawn immediately from intuition simpliciter. Exact concepts have as their correlates essences which have the characteristic of&quot;z</span><span class="font7">•或 </span><span class="font17">as&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the Kantian sense.</span><span class="font17"> Contrasted with these ideas, or ideal essences, we find </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">morphological essences</span><span class="font17"> as the correlates of descriptive concepts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">That ideation which yields ideal essences, as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ideal &quot;limits&quot;</span><span class="font17"> which it is essentially impossible to find in any sensuous intuition but which morphological essences &quot;approach&quot; more or less closely without ever &lt;139&gt; reaching them — this ideation is fundamentally different in its essence from the seizing upon an essence by simple &quot;abstraction'' in which a salient &quot;moment&quot; is raised into the region of essences as something essentially vague, as something typical.<sup>18</sup> The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">firmness and the pure distinguishability &quot;generic concepts,</span><span class="font17"> or generic essences, which have their extension in the realm of fluidity, must not be confused with the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">exactness &quot;&nbsp;ideal concepts</span><span class="font17"> and of genera which include only the idea in their extension.<sup>19</sup> It can then be seen, furthermore, that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">exact sciences</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely descriptive sciences</span><span class="font17"> do indeed combine but that they cannot take the place of the other, that no exact science, i.e., no science operating with ideal substructions, no matter how highly developed, can perform the original and legitimate tasks of pure description.<sup>20</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. Phenomenology as a Descriptive Eidetic Doctrine of Pure Mental Processes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">As for phenomenology, it is concerned to be a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">descriptive</span><span class="font17"> eidetic doctrine of transcendentally pure mental processes as viewed in the phenomenological attitude; and, like any other descriptive, non-substructing and non-idealizing discipline, it has its inherent legitimacy. Whatever can be apprehended eidetically in pure intuition as belonging to reduced mental processes, either as a really inherent component part or as an intentional correlate of the latter, properly belongs to phenomenology and is for it a great source of absolute cognitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But let us examine somewhat more closely the extent to which actually scientific descriptions can become established in the phenomenological field with its innumerable eidetic concreta, and what such descriptions are in a position to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">MarginalnoteinCopyA:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Yet anotherfundamentalkindofabstractionisthaloffbrmingfbrmal-ontological eidetic concepts</span></p>

But the latter need not be considered here in the material sphere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>20</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MarginalnoteinCopy A:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> That is not correct because thedinerence between a limit-idea and a formal idea is not taken into consideration. On the other hand, material disciplines and material eidetic laws were the things to be considered here.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">It is peculiar to consciousness of whatever sort that it fluctuates in flowing away in various dimensions in such a manner that there can be no speaking of a conceptually exact fixing of any eidetic concreta or of any of their immediately constitutive moments. Let us take, for example, a mental process of the genus, &quot;phantasy of a physical thing,&quot; as that process is given to us in a phenomenological-immanental perception or in an (always reduced) intuition of some other kind. Then the phenomenologically single example (the eidetic singularity) is that physical thing-phantasy in the entire fullness ofits concretion precisely as it flows smoothly in the flux of mental processes, precisely the determinateness and indeterminateness with which </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">140</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">it makes its physical thing appear now from one side and now from another, precisely in the distinctness or blurriness, in the vacillating clarity and intermittent obscurity, etc., which are indeed proper to it. Phenomenology not </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font17"> drops </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the individuation</span><span class="font17"> but elevates the whole essential content, in the fullness of its concretion, into eidetic consciousness and takes it as an ideally identical essence which, like any other essence, could be singularized not only hie et nunc but also in countless examples. One sees at once that there can be no thought of a conceptual and terminological </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fixing</span><span class="font17"> of this or any other such fluid </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">concretum,</span><span class="font17"> and that the same holds with respect to each ofits immediate and no less fluid parts and abstract moments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But though there can be no speaking of an unambiguous determining of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic singularities</span><span class="font17"> in our sphere of description, the situation is quite otherwise in the case of essences belonging to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">higher levels of specificity.</span><span class="font17"> These are accessible to rigid differentiation, to continuous identifying maintenance </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Durchhaltung]</span><span class="font17">, and strict conceptual formulation and likewise to analysis into component essences; and accordingly in their case the tasks of a comprehensive scientific description can be imposed as meaningful tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus we describe and, in so doing, determine by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">strict</span><span class="font17"> concepts the generic essence of perception taken universally or that of subordinate species, such as the perception of physical things and their determinations, the perception of animate beings, etc.; likewise the essence of memory taken universally, empathy taken universally, willing taken universally, etc. Prior to these, however, are the highest universalities: the mental process taken universally, the cogitatio taken universally, which already make extensive essential descriptions possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Marginal note in Copy D</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">：</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> That is too restricted</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The nature of the process of seizing upon, analyzing, and describing generic essences is obviously such that what can be done at higher levels is not dependent on what has been done at lower levels, e.g., in such a manner that a systematic inductive procedure might be the required method, a gradual ascending of the scale of increasing universality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Still another consequence may be added here. According to what has been stated, deductive theorizings are excluded from phenomenology. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Mediate inferences</span><span class="font17"> are not exactly denied to it; but, since all its cognitions ought to be descriptive, purely befitting the immanental sphere, inferences, non-intuitive modes of procedure of any kind, only have the methodic function of leading us to the matters in question upon which a subsequent direct seeing of essences must make given. Analogies which emerge may suggest presumed likelihoods about concatenations of essences prior to actual intuition, and &lt;141&gt; conclusions may be drawn from them; but ultimately an actual seeing of the concatenations of essences must redeem the presumed likelihoods. As long as that has not occurred, we have no phenomenological result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the eidetic province of reduced phenomena (either as a whole or in some partial province), this admittedly does not answer the pressing question of whether, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">besides</span><span class="font17"> the descriptive procedure, one might not follow — as a counterpart to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">descriptive</span><span class="font17"> phenomenology — an idealizing procedure which substitutes pure and strict ideals for intuited data and might even serve as the fundamental means for a mathesis of mental processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However much the investigations just carried out were compelled to leave open, they have advanced us considerably and not just by bringing a series ofimportant problems within our field of vision. It is now completely clear to us that nothing of value for the establishing of phenomenology can be gained by proceeding according to analogy. It is only a misleading prejudice to believe that the methods of historically given a priori sciences, all of which are exclusively<sup>22</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">exact </span><span class="font17">sciences of ideal objects, must serve forthwith as models for every new science, particularly for our transcendental phenomenology </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">as though there could be<sup>23</sup> eidetic sciences of but one single methodic type, that of &quot;exactness.'' Transcendental phenomenology, as a</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">descriptive science of essence, belongs however to a</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fundamental class of eidetic sciences totally different</span><span class="font17"> from the one to which the mathematical sciences belong.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§76 . The Theme of the Following Investigations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">The realm of transcendental consciousness as the realm of what is, in a determined sense, “absolute&quot; being, has been provided us by the phenomenological reduction. It is the primal category of all being (or, in our terminology, the primal region), the one in which all other regions of being are rooted, to which, according to their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence,</span><span class="font17"> they are relative and on which they are therefore all essentially dependent. The theory of categories must start entirely from this most radical of all ontological distinctions — being </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as consciousness</span><span class="font17"> and being as something which becomes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^manifested^</span><span class="font17"> in consciousness, &quot;transcendent'' being — which, as we see, can be attained in its</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">142</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">purity and appreciated only by the method of the phenomenological reduction. In the essential relationship between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">transcendental</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">transcendent</span><span class="font17"> being are rooted all the relationships already touched on by us repeatedly but later to be explored more profoundly, between phenomenology and all other sciences — relationships in the sense of which it is implicit that the dominion of phenomenology includes in a certain remarkable manner all the other sciences. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The excluding has at the same time the characteristic of a revaluing change in sign; and with this change the revalued affair finds a place once again in the phenomenological sphere.</span><span class="font17"> Figuratively speaking, that which is parenthesized is not erased from the phenomenological blackboard but only parenthesized, and thereby provided with an index. As having the latter it is, however, part of the major theme of inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is absolutely necessary that this situation with the points of view peculiar to it be understood thoroughly. Included here is, for example, the fact that physical Nature undergoes exclusion, while at the same time there is not only a phenomenology of natural-scientific consciousness as a matter of natural-scientific experiencing and think-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ing but also a phenomenology of Nature itself as the correlate of natural-scientific consciousness. Likewise, though psychology and the cultural sciences are affected by the excluding, there is a phenomenology of man, his personality, his personal properties and his (human) flow of consciousness; furthermore, a phenomenology of the social mind, of social formations, cultural products, etc. Everything transcendent, in as much as it becomes given in consciousness, is an object for phenomenological investigation not only with respect to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consciousness of it</span><span class="font17"> — e.g., the different modes of consciousness in which it becomes given as the same — but also, though this is essentially involved with the former, as what is given and accepted in the modes of givenness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus there are immense domains of phenomenological research for which one is not in the least prepared when one starts out from the idea of the mental process </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">especially if one begins, as we all do, with the psychological attitude and has allowed the concept of the mental process to be prescribed for him in the first place by the psychology of our times — and which one will at first be little inclined to accept as at all phenomenological because of the influence of &lt;143&gt; internal hindrances. In the case of psychology and the cultural sciences this inclusion of what has been parenthesized results in quite peculiar and at first rather confusing situations. To indicate this only in the case of psychology we note that consciousness, as a datum of psychological experience, thus as human or brute consciousness, is an object of psychology, in experiential-scientific research, an object of empirical psychology</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> in essential-scientific research, an object of eidetic psychology.<sup>1</sup> On the other hand, as having the modification effected by parenthesizing, the whole world with all its psychical individuals and their psychical processes, belongs in phenomenology</span><span class="font11">：</span><span class="font17"> all of it as a correlate of absolute consciousness. Consciousness therefore makes its appearance here in different modes of apprehension and different contexts, and different ones moreover within phenomenology itself namely, within the latter itself first as absolute consciousness and secondly, in the correlate, as psychological consciousness which occurs in the natural world — as in a certain manner revalued, yet without losing the content peculiar to it as conscious-Those are difficult and extraordinarily important contexts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">hey account for the fact that any phenomenological finding concer-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ning absolute consciousness can be reinterpreted as an eidetic-psychological finding (which, strictly considered, is itself by no means phenomenological), although here the phenomenological modes of observing things is the more inclusive and, as absolute, is the more radical mode. To see all this and consequently to confer a completely transparent clarity on the essential relationships between pure phenomenology, on the one hand, and eidetic and empirical psychology (or cultural sciences, as the case may be) on the other hand, is of great concern to those disciplines and to philosophy. Specifically psychology, which is aspiring so strongly in our times, can acquire the radical foundation still lacking to it only if it has at its command far-reaching insights into the essential contexts indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The indications just given make us sensible of how far we still are from an understanding of phenomenology. We have learned to practice the phenomenological attitude; we have removed a number of confusing methodological objections; we have defended the legitimacy of a pure description: the field of research lies open. But we do not yet know </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">major themes</span><span class="font17"> are in &lt;that field&gt;; more particularly, what </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fundamental lines of description are prescribed by the most universal essential species &quot;&nbsp;mental processes.</span><span class="font17"> To produce clarity in these connections, in the following chapters we shall attempt to characterize</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">144</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">just these most universal essential species, at least with respect to some especially important traits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With these new considerations we are not actually forsaking the problem of method. Our discussions of method up to the present were already determined by the most universal insights into the essence of the phenomenological sphere. It is obvious that a more penetrating knowledge of the latter — not with respect to its single particulars but with respect to the all-prevasive universalities — must also put into our hands norms of method which have a richer content and which are, at the same time, norms with which all specific methods must square. A method, after all, is nothing which is, or which can be, brought in from outside. Rather than a method, formal logic and formal noetics provide only the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">form</span><span class="font17"> of a possible method</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> and useful as a knowledge of form may be methodologically, a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">determinate</span><span class="font17"> method ——determined not with respect to its technical particularity but with respect to the universal type of method &lt;to which it belongs&gt; — is a norm which arises from the fundamental regional specificity and the universal structures of the province in question, so that a cognitive seizing upon such a method depends essentially on knowledge of these structures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">§77 . </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Reflection as a Fundamental Peculiarity of the Sphere of Mental Processes. Studies in Reflection.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Among the most universal essential peculiarities of the sphere of pure mental processes we shall deal with </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reflection</span><span class="font17"> first. We shall do so because of its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universal</span><span class="font17"> methodological function: the phenomenological method operates exclusively in acts of reflection. But concerning the efficacy of reflection and therefore the possibility of any phenomenology whatever there exist skeptical doubts which we wish to remove completely at the outset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Already in our preliminary deliberations we had to speak of reflection.<sup>2</sup> The results which we achieved there, even before entering the field of phenomenology, we can still take over now while rigorously effecting the phenomenological reduction, since those findings concerned only what is essentially peculiar to mental processes, thus, as we know, what need only be transcendentally purified with respect to the formulation placed upon them in order for us to retain them as a secure possession. First of all we shall recapitulate what is already familiar and attempt at the same time to penetrate more deeply into the subject-matter as well as into the nature of the phenomenological studies made possible and demanded by reflection.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;145&gt; Each Ego is living its mental processes, and in the latter a great variety is included really-inherently and intentively.<sup>3</sup> It lives them: that is not to say that it has them and &lt;has&gt; its &quot;eye on” what they include and is seizing upon them in the manner characteristic of an experiencing of something immanent or of any other intuiting and objectivating of something immanent. Any mental process which is not an object of regard can, with respect to ideal possibility, become <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>regarded;<sup>,?</sup> a reflection on the part of the Ego is directed to it, it now becomes an object </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font17"> the Ego. The situation is the same in the case of possible Ego-regards directed to the components of the mental process and to its intentionalities (to that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of which</span><span class="font17"> the mental process may be a consciousness). In turn, the reflections are mental processes and, as reflections, can become the substrates of new reflections; and so on ad infinitum as a matter of essentially necessary universality.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">When the mental process which, at any particular time, is actually being lived comes into reflective regard it becomes given </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font17"> actually being lived, as existing &quot;now.” But not only that: it becomes given as havingjust now </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">been</span><span class="font17"> and, in so far as it was unregarded, precisely as having been unregarded, as not having been reflected on. In the natural attitude, without our thinking about it, we take it for granted that mental processes do not exist only when we advert to them and seize upon them in an experience of something immanent; and we also take it for granted that they actually existed and, indeed, were actually lived by us if they are still, in reflection on something immanent, within </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">retention</span><span class="font17"> (&quot;primary&quot; memory) as having been &quot;just now,&quot; &quot;still intended to.&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We are convinced moreover that reflection on the basis of and &quot;in&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">recollection</span><span class="font17"> gives us cognizance of our earlier mental processes, the ones which were present &quot;then,&quot; which were then perceivable, though not perceived, as something immanent.<sup>4</sup> According to the naively natural view the very same holds with respect to anticipation, to forward-looking expectation. The first thing to be considered in that connection is immediate </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;protention^</span><span class="font17"> (as we might say), the precise counterpart of immediate retention; and then, presentiating in a quite different way, the anticipation which is, in more proper sense, reproductive and is the counterpart of recollection </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Wieder^rxn-</span><span class="font17">nerung]. &lt;ln such anticipation</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">the intuitively expected, that to which one intends in foresight as &quot;coming in the future/<sup>5</sup> has at the same time, owing to possible reflection &quot;in&quot; anticipation, the signification of something which will be perceived; just as the retrospectively remembered has the signification of something which was perceived. Thus we can reflect in anticipation too, and become aware of mental processes of our own upon which we were not focused in it, as processes belonging to the anticipated as such: as we do whenever we say that we </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">shall see</span><span class="font17"> what is coming, our reflective regard on such occasions adverting to the &quot;fUture&quot; mental processes of perception.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;H6&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">We make all that clear to ourselves in the natural attitude, perhaps as psychologists, and we trace the broader contexts in which the phenomena are involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we now effect the phenomenological<sup>5</sup> reduction, our findings (inside their parentheses) change into exemplificatory cases of eidetic</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">universalities which we can appropriate and systematically study within the limits of pure intuition. For example, in a living intuition (which even may be imaginary) we put ourselves into the effecting of some act or other, perhaps into a rejoicing at a course of theoretical thought which goes on freely and fruitfully. We effect all the reductions and see what lies in the pure essence of the phenomenological matters here. First of all, then, a being adverted to the thought which are going on. We develop the exemplificatory phenomenon still further: During the pleasing course of thoughts a reflective regard becomes adverted to the rejoicing. The latter becomes a mental process regarded and perceived as something immanent, fluctuating and fading away thus and so as it is regarded reflectively. At the same time, the freedom of the course of thought suffers; we are now conscious ofit in a modified manner; the pleasingness belonging to its continuance is also affected essentially — that too we can observe by adverting our &lt;reflective&gt; regard in yet other directions. But let us leave this out of considerations now and take note of the following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The first reflection on the rejoicing finds it as actually present now, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">but not as only now beginning.</span><span class="font17"> It is there as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">continuing</span><span class="font17"> to endure, as already lived before, only not looked at. That is, there evidently exists the possibility of tracing the past duration and mode of givenness of what is pleasing, of paying attention to earlier phases in the course of the theoretical course of thought and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">also</span><span class="font17"> to the regard which was previously directed to it; on the other hand, there exists the possibility of paying attention to the rejoicing advertence to it and, by contrast, to seize upon the lack of a regard adverted to it in the phenomenon which has run its course. But also, with respect to the rejoicing which has subsequently become an object, we have the possibility of effecting a reflection on the reflection which objec-tivates the latter and of thus making even more effectively clear the difference between a rejoicing which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">lived,</span><span class="font17"> but not regarded, and a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">regarded</span><span class="font17"> rejoicing; likewise the modifications which are introduced by the acts of seizing-upon. explicating, etc., which start with the advertence of regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">147</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">All that we can consider in the phenomenological attitude and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetically,</span><span class="font17"> either in its higher universality or with respect to whatever may come to light essentially in the case of particular kinds of mental processes. The entire stream of mental processes, with the lived processes which, in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mode of consciousness as not modified reflectionally <sub>9 </sub></span><span class="font17">belong to it, can thus be submitted to a scientific eidetic study aiming</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">at systematic completeness and, more particularly, with respect also to all the possibilities of mental process-moments </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intentively</span><span class="font17"> contained in them and therefore specifically with respect to the mental processes which are perhaps intended to in them in a modified manner and to the intentionalia of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">these</span><span class="font17"> processes. We have already become acquainted with examples of the latter in the form of those modifications of mental processes which are intentively included in all presen-tiations and can be singled out by reflection &quot;in&quot; presentiations: for example, the &quot;was-perceived&quot; which is contained in any memory and the <sup>^t</sup>will-be-pe^ceived^^ contained in every expectation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The study of the stream of mental processes is, for its part, carried on in variety of peculiarly structured reflective acts which themselves also belong in the stream of mental processes and which, in corresponding reflections at a higher level, can be made the Objects of phenomenological analyses. This is because their analysis is fundamental to a universal phenomenology and to the methodological insight quite indispensible to it. Something similar is obviously true in the case of psychology. By vague references to a study of mental processes in reflection or in memory </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">which people usually identify with reflection ——nothing is accomplished, apart from many a falsity which is frequently combined directly with such references (precisely because of the lack of serious eidetic analysis) such as, e.g., that there can be no such thing at all as perception and observation of something immanent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us enter somewhat more closely into these matters.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§78 . The Phenomenological Study of Reflections on Mental Processes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">According to what hasjust been explained, reflection is a name for acts in which the stream of mental processes, with all its manifold occurrences (mental process-moments, intentionalia) become evidentially apprehensible and analyzable. It is, as we can also say, the name of the method of consciousness leading to the cognition of any consciousness whatever. By this very method, however, it itself becomes an Object of possible studies: Reflection is also the name for kinds of mental processes which belong essentially together and is therefore the theme of a main chapter of phenomenology. The task of &lt;148&gt; that chapter is to distinguish the different &quot;reflections'' and analyze them all in a systematic order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this connection, first of all, one must make it clear that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^reflection&quot;' &quot;any kind</span><span class="font17"> has the characteristic of being a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">modification</span><span class="font17"> &quot;&nbsp;a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consciousness</span><span class="font17"> and, moreover, a modification which essentially </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any consciousness</span><span class="font17"> can undergo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We speak here of modification because any reflection is, according to its essence, the consequence of changes in attitude whereby an already given mental process or really immanental Datum thereof (one not modified reflectionally) undergoes a certain transmutation precisely into the mode of consciousness (or object of consciousness) reflectionally modified. The already given mental process can itself already have the characteristic of reflectionally modified consciousness of something, so that the new modification belongs to a higher level; but ultimately we get back to mental processes which are absolutely unmodified reflectionally, and to the really inherent and the intentive dabile belonging to them. Now, according to an eidetic law, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font17"> mental process can become converted into reflectional modifications, and &lt;can be converted&gt; along different lines with which we shall become more precisely acquainted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The fundamental methodological significance of the eidetic study of the reflections for phenomenology and, no less, for psychology, is shown by the fact that under reflection all modes of the seizing upon the essence of something immanent and, on the other hand, of experiencing something immanent, are included. Included therefore is, e.g., perception ofsomething immanent which is, in fact, a reflection in so far as it presupposes a turning of one's regard from something else of which one was conscious to the consciousness of that something. In like manner, as we mentioned (in the last section) when discussing the taken-fbr-granted features of the natural attitude, any memory admits not only of a reflective turning of one's regard to it itself but also of the peculiar modification of reflection “in&quot; memory. In memory there is at first, perhaps, consciousness of, e.g., the course ofa piece ofmusic unmodified reflectionally in the mode of the “past.&quot; But there belongs to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of the object of such a consciousness the possibility of reflecting on the having-been-perceived of that object. There likewise exists for expectation, for consciousness foreseeing &quot;what is coming,&quot; the eidetic possibility of turning one's regard away from what is coming to its having-become-perceived. Inherent in these eidetic connections is the fact that the statements, <sup>&lt;4</sup>I remember A&quot; and “I have perceived A,&quot; “I foresee A&quot; and “I will perceive AJ are a priori and immediately equivalent — but they are only equivalent since the sense is different in each case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Here the phenomenological task is to investigate systematically all &lt;149&gt; the modifications of mental processes falling under the heading of reflection, in connection with all the modifications to which they are essentially related and which they </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">presuppose.</span><span class="font17"> The latter concerns the totality of essential modifications which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font17"> mental process must undergo during its originary course and, in addition, the different kinds of variations which can be conceived idealiter as effected on each mental process by means of &quot;operations.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In itself every mental process is a flux of becoming, is what it is in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">generation originaliter</span><span class="font17"> of an invariant essential type; it is a continuous flow of retentions and protentions mediated by a flowing phase of originarity itself in which there is consciousness of the living now of the mental process in contradistinction to its &quot;befbre&quot; and &quot;after.&quot;6 On the other hand, every mental process has its parallel in the different forms of reproductions which can be regarded as ideally inherent <sup>t&lt;</sup>operative<sup>,?</sup> transformations of the original mental process: each has its <sup>44</sup>precisely corresponding&quot; and yet thoroughly modified counterpart in a recollection, likewise in a possible anticipation, in a possible mere<sup>7</sup> phantasy and, again, in the reiterations of such variations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Naturally we conceive all the parallelized mental processes as parallelized processes of a common essential composition: the parallel mental processes should therefore intend to the same intentional objectivities, and intend to them in identical modes of givenness by virtue of the range of all those which, in other respects of possible variation, can take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Because the<sup>8</sup> modifications under consideration belong to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any </span><span class="font17">mental process as ideally inherent possible variations, thus to a certain extent designating operations idealiter which can be thought of as effected on any &lt;mental process&gt;, they are reiterable </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ad infinitum, </span><span class="font17">they are also to be effected on the modified mental processes. Conversely, starting from any mental process already characterized as such a modification, and which then </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in itself is</span><span class="font17"> always characterized as that </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">modification</span><span class="font7">》，</span><span class="font17">we are led back to certain primal mental processes, to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">impressions<sup>33</sup></span><span class="font17"> which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">absolutely originary</span><span class="font17"> mental processes exhibit in the phenomenological sense. Thus </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">perceptions</span><span class="font17"> of physical things are originary mental processes in relation to all rememberings, presentiations</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">in phantasy; and so forth. They are therefore as originary as concrete mental processes can be universally. This is because they have in &lt;&nbsp;150&gt; their concretion, more precisely considered, only </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one,</span><span class="font17"> but also always a continuously flowing, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">absolutely originary</span><span class="font17"> phase — the moment of the living </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We can relate these modifications primarily to the actionally conscious mental processes not reflectionally modified, since we can see at once that everything intended to in reflectionally modified consciousness eo ipso must acquire a share in these primary modifications by the fact that they, as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reflections</span><span class="font17"> on mental processes and taken in full concretion, are themselves conscious mental processes not reflectionally modified and as not so modified take on all modifications. Now, reflection is certainly itself a new kind of universal modification —this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">directing</span><span class="font17"> itself to mental processes pertaining to the Ego and in unity with the effecting of acts of the cogito (particularly of acts belonging to the lowest, fundamental stratum, that of presentation simpliciter) &quot;in&quot; which the Ego directs itself to its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mental processes;</span><span class="font17"> but just the combining of reflection with intuitive or empty apprehensions or seizing-upon conditions the necessary combining of the study of the reflectional modifications with that of the modifications indicated above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">By the reflectional </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">experiencing</span><span class="font17"> acts alone we know something of the stream of mental processes and of the necessary relatedness of the &lt;stream&gt; to the pure Ego; thus we know that it is a field of free effectings of cogitationes belonging to one and the same pure Ego; that all mental processes of the stream are the Ego's precisely in so far as it regards or can direct its regard &quot;through&quot; &lt;the stream&gt; to something other than the Ego. Weare convinced that these experienc-ings also preserve their sense and legitimacy as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reduced</span><span class="font17"> &lt;experienc-ings&gt;, and in generical eidetic universality we seize upon the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">legitimacy</span><span class="font17"> of any experiencings of such a characteristic, just as, in a way parallel with that, we seize upon the legitimacy of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">seeing an essence </span><span class="font17">related to any mental process whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus, e.g., we seize upon </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the absolute legitimacy</span><span class="font17"> of reflection on </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">preceiving</span><span class="font17"> something immanent, i.e., perception simpliciter of something immanent<sup>9</sup> and, more particularly, with respect to what, in its flowing away, it actually makes given originarily</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> similarly, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">absolute legitimacy of retention of something immanent</span><span class="font17"> with respect to what</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Marginal note in Copy A:</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cf. Lectures of 1922/23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">is intended to in it in the characteristic of what is <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>stilP<sup>,</sup> living and what has 'just now&quot; been, but of course only so far as the content of what is thus characterized reaches. Thus, e.g., in view of the fact that it was the perceiving of a tone and not of a color. We likewise seize upon the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">relative</span><span class="font17"> legitimacy of recollection of something immanent which reaches so far as the content of this remembering, singly regarded, shows the genuine recollection-characteristic (which, universally, by no means is done by each moment remembered) — a legitimacy which occurs entirely in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font17"> recollection. But, of course, it is merely a &quot;relative&quot; &lt;legitimacy&gt;, one which can be outweighed no matter to what extent it is still a legitimacy. And so forth.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;151&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">As a consequence, we see with the most perfect clarity and with the consciousness of unconditioned validity that it would be countersens-ical to mean that mental processes would be cognitionally assured only to the extent that they are given in the reflectional consciousness pertaining to the perceiving of something immanent; or even that they would only be assured in the particular actual Now; that it would be wrong to doubt the having existed of what, in the turning back of the regard, is found as &quot;still&quot; intended to (the immediate retention); and, again, &lt;it is wrong&gt; finally to doubt whether mental processes which become the object of a regard are not, as a consequence, converted to to coelo into something different; and so forth. It is only necessary here not to let oneself be confused by arguments which, in all formal precision, allow that conformity to the primal source, to that of pure intuition, be confounded; it is necessary to remain faithful to the ''principle of all principles^^ that perfect clarity is the measure of all truth, and that statements which faithfully express their data need not be concerned about arguments, no matter how refined they may yet be.</span></p>

No matter how closely akin the difficulties of both sides &lt;&nbsp;152&gt; are, there is still a diflerence between whether we ask, &lt;on the one hand&gt;, about the range and the essentially necessary cognitive value of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">existential</span><span class="font17"> findings which give expression to the givennesses of our (human) experiences of the internal — we therefore ask about psychological method; or if we ask, on the other hand, about the phenomenological method, about the essentially necessary possibility and range of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essential</span><span class="font17"> findings which, on the ground of pure reflection, should concern mental processes as mental processes with respect to their own being free from natural apperception. Nevertheless, between both &lt;methods&gt; there subsist inner relationships, indeed in an appreciable measure congruences, whichjustify our taking into consideration Watt's objections, in particularly significant statements such as the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;One can indeed scarcely even inquire into the likelihood of how one arrives at the cognition of immediate mental living. For it is neither knowledge nor the object ofknowledge; it is rather something else. It is not to be discerned how a report about the mental living of mental living, even when it is there, could be put down on paper.<sup>55 </sup>&quot;But this is always the ultimate question of the fundamental problem of self-observation.<sup>5 5</sup> &quot;Today one designates this absolute description as phenomenology.<sup>5 511</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Reviewing the work of Th. Lipps, Watt then further states: &quot;The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">known / gewu^ten</span><span class="font17"> / actuality of objects of self-observation stands over against the actuality of the present Ego and the present consciousness-processes. This actuality is mentally lived [namely, merely lived, not 'known,' i.e., not seized upon reflectively]. It is therefore precisely absolute actuality.<sup>55 &lt;4</sup>One may now be of a very different conviction,&quot; he now adds for his part, &quot;about what one can do</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">with this absolute actuality... Moreover, it is a matter here only of the results of self-observation. When, now, this ever retrospective observation is always knowledge about mental processes]ust </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">had</span><span class="font17"> as objects, how can one establish the states of which one has no knowledge, of which there is only consciousness? Indeed, it all turns on the importance of the whole discussion o£ namely, the derivation of the concept of immediate mental living which is not knowledge. One must be able to observe. Finally, each of us lives mentally. Only he does not </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font17"> it. And ifhe were to know it, how can he know that his mental living is in actuality absolutely thus as he thinks it is? From whose head does &lt;153&gt; phenomenology spring fully armed? Is a phenomenology possible and in which sense? All of these questions thrust themselves to the fore. Perhaps a discussion of the question of selfbbservation by experimental psychology will shed new light on this domain. For the problem of phenomenology is one which also necessarily arises for experimental psychology. Perhaps the latter<sup>5</sup>s answer will also be more careful since it lacks the zeal of the discoverer of phenomenology. In any case, it is, by virtue of itself, referred more to an inductive method.<sup>5512</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With the pious belief in the omnipotence of the inductive<sup>13</sup> method referred to in the last lines (and which Watt would scarcely be able to maintain ifhe were to reflect on the conditions for the possibility of this method), it is certainly surprising to find the admission &quot;that a functional-analytic psychology will never be able to explain the facts of knowledge.<sup>5514</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In contrast to these statements characteristic of recent psychology —precisely in so far as they are meant psychologically — we must bring to light, in the first place, the separation made above between psychological and phenomenological questions and, in this respect emphasize the fact that a phenomenological doctrine of essences is of no more interest to the method by which the phenomenologist can make sure of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">existence</span><span class="font17"> of those mental processes which serve him as foundations for his phenomenological findings than the geometer would be interested in how the existence of figures on the board or the models on the shelf could be methodologically established. As sciences of pure essence, geometry and phenomenology do not recognize any findings about real existence. Connected with just that is the fact</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">that clear feignings not only offer them foundations as good as, but to a great extent better than, the data of actual perception and experience.<sup>15</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Ifi now, phenomenology does not, as a consequence, have to make existential findings about mental processes, if it thus need not make &quot;experiences&quot; and &quot;observations&quot; in the natural sense, in the sense in which a science of matters of fact must support itself by them, it nevertheless makes eidetic findings about reflectionally unmodified mental processes as the essentially necessary condition of its possibility. But it owes this to reflection, more precisely to reflectional intui-&lt;154&gt; tion of essences. As a result, the skeptical doubt with respect to selfobservation likewise comes into view for phenomenology; it comes into view for phenomenology, more particularly, in so far as this doubt allows of being extended in an obvious way from reflection on something immanent to reflection taken universally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As a matter of fact, what should phenomenology become if it &quot;were not to be seen how a report about the mental living of mental living, even when it is there, could be put down on paper&quot;? What should be made of phenomenology ifit could make statements about the essence of &quot;known,&quot; reflectionally modified mental processes but not about mental processes pure and simple? What should it be if &quot;one can scarcely even inquire into the likelihood of how one arrives at cognition of immediate mental living?^^ ——or, to cognition of its essence? It may be that phenomenology cannot produce any existential findings in relation to the mental processes which hover before it as examples for its ideation. Yet in these ideations it only sees, one can object, ideas of just what it has before its eyes at the moment in the examples. As soon as its regard adverts to the mental process, it only adverts to what is now presented to the regard, just as when it turns away the regard it adverts to a different &lt;mental process&gt;. The essence seized upon is only the essence of the reflectionally modified mental process; and the conviction proves to be completely ungrounded that by reflection we can acquire absolutely valid cognitions true for any mental process whatever, be it reflectionally modified or not. &quot;How can one establish states,&quot; even as essential possibilities, <sup>4&lt;</sup>of which one can have no knowledge?^^</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">That obviously concerns every kind of reflection, although in phenomenology each of them still holds as the source of absolute</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">authors's footnote:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cf. above, §70, pp. 129ff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">cognitions. In phantasy a physical thing, be it even a centaur, hovers before me. I mean to know that it is presented in certain &quot;modes of appearance/<sup>5</sup> in certain &quot;adumbrations of sensations/<sup>5</sup> apprehensions, and so forth. I mean to have there the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic</span><span class="font17"> insight that such an object taken universally </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font17"> only be intuited in that kind of modes of appearance only by means of such and such adumbrationai functions and whatever else might play a role here. But having my eye on the centaur, I do not regard its modes of appearance, adumbrative Data, apprehensions; and seizing upon its essence, I do not seize upon those modes of appearance, Data and apprehensions and their essence. A certain reflective turning of the regard to them is necessary, but which modifies and brings the whole mental process into flux; and in the new &lt;act of&gt; ideation I therefore have my eye on something new and need not assert that I have acquired the eidetic components of the reflectionally unmodified mental process. Nor need I assert that it &lt;155&gt; pertains to the essence of a physical thing as physical to be presented in &quot;appearances,&quot; to be adumbrated by Data of sensation of the kind indicated which, on their side, undergo apprehensions, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Obviously the difficulty also concerns analyses of consciousness with respect to the &quot;sense&quot; ofintentive mental processes, with respect to everything which belongs to what is meant, to what is intentionally objective as intentional, to the sense of a statement; and the like. For that too is analysis within the relevantly directed reflections. Watt himself even goes so far as to say that &quot;psychology must make it clear that in the case of seif-observation the relation to something objective pertaining to the mental processes to be described changes. Perhaps this change has a much greater signification than one is inclined to believe.<sup>,</sup></span><span class="font11"><sup>，</sup></span><span class="font17"><sup>16</sup> If Watt is right, then we would, as a consequence, be asserting too much by claiming in seif-observation that we were just now attentive to this book here and were still attentive to it. At best that holds prior to reflection. But reflection changed &quot;the mental process to be described&quot; pertaining to attention and, more particularly (according to Watt), with respect to the relation to something objective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Ail genuine skepticism of whatever kind and persuasion is indicated by the essentially necessary countersense that, in its argumentations, it implicitly presupposes as conditions of the possibility of its validity precisely what it denies in its theses. Without difficulty one</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">can persuade himself that this feature is equally true of the argumentations under discussion. He who also says: I doubt the cognitive signification of reflection, asserts a countersense. For as he declares his doubt, he reflects, and setting down this statement as valid presupposes that reflection actually and without doubt (sc/, for the cases present) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">has</span><span class="font17"> the cognitive value doubted, that it does </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font17"> change the relation to something objective, that the reflectionally unmodified mental process does </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font17"> forfeit its essence in the transition to reflection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Furthermore: The argumentations continuously speak of reflection as a matter of fact and of that which it encumbers and can encumber; as a consequence, one also speaks, naturally, of the &quot;unknown,&quot; reflectionally unmodified mental processes as, again, matters of fact, namely as those on the basis of which the reflectionally modified processes arise. Therefore a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">knowledge</span><span class="font17"> of reflectionally unmodified mental processes, among them reflectionally unmodified reflections, is continuously presupposed, while at the same time the possibility of that knowledge is placed in question. This occurs in so &lt;156&gt; far as there is doubt concerning the possibility of claiming </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">anything whatever</span><span class="font17"> about the content of the reflectionally unmodified mental process and about the production of reflection: to what extent does it change the original mental process, and does it falsify it, so to speak, making it a totally different &lt;mental process&gt;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, it is clear that if this doubt and the possibility posited in it were legitimate, there would not remain the slightest ground of justification for the certainty that a reflectionally unmodified mental process and a reflection are given and can be given at all. It is clear, moreover, that the &lt;certainty&gt; which indeed was the continual presupposition can only be known by reflection, and that it can only be legitimated as immediate knowledge by a reflectionally presentive intuition. The case is the same with respect to the assertions of the actuality or the possibility of modifications which subsequently came by reflection. But if the like </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font17"> given by intuition, then it is given in an intuitional content; it is therefore countersensical to assert that there is here nothing cognizable, nothing with respect to the content of the reflectionally unmodified mental process and the kind of modifications which it undergoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">All that is sufficient to make the countersense distinct. Here, as everywhere, the skepticism loses its force by going back from verbal argumentations to eidetic intuition, to originarily presentive intui-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">tion and the legitimacy primally its own. Of course, everything depends on one also actually effecting it and being capable of raising what is in question into the light of genuine eidetic clarity or presentations, as we have tried to do in the previous paragraphs — thus taking them up in the same intuitive way in which they have been effected and offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The phenomena of reflection are, in fact, a sphere of pure and possibly perfectly clear data. It is an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic insight,</span><span class="font17"> always attainable because immediate, that starting from the objectively given as objective reflection on the presentive consciousness and its subject is always possible: starting from the perceived, from what is &quot;there 'in person','' a reflection on the perceiving; starting from the remembered, just as it &quot;hovers before us&quot; as remembered, as &quot;having been,&quot; a reflection on the remembering; starting from the statement in the flowing oflT of its being given, a reflection on the stating, etc. As a consequence, the perceiving becomes given as the perceiving of just this perceived, the present consciousness becomes given as consciousness of something intended to. It is evident that by virtue of its essence —thus not for adventitious reasons, perchance merely &quot;fbr us&quot; and our adventitious ''psychological constitution^^ — something such as &lt;157&gt; consciousness and consciousness-content (in the sense of what is really inherent or intentional) is cognizable by reflection. God is also bound to this absolute necessity given in insight, just as He is to discerning that 2 + 1 = 1 4- 2. Even God can only acquire cognition of His consciousness and consciousness-content by reflection.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In that connection, it is said at the same time that with the ideal of perfect cognition reflection cannot be implicated in any antinomian controversy. We have had to emphasize many times that each species ofbeing has, owing to its essence, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font17"> modes of givenness and with that its own cognitive method. It is countersensical to treat their essential peculiarities as deficiencies, let alone to count them among the sort of adventitious, factual deficiencies pertaining to &quot;our human&quot; cognition. Another question, but likewise to be considered in eidetic insight, is, however, that about the possible &quot;range&quot; of the cognition <sup>ln</sup> question; it is thus the question about how we are to protect ourselves from statements which go beyond what is actually given at</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">the moment and which is to be seized upon eidetically. And still another question concerns the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">empirical</span><span class="font17"> methods: how do we human beings have to proceed, for instance as psychologists, under given psychological circumstances in order to confer upon our human cognitions the highest dignity possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In addition, we must emphasize that our repeated recourse to insight (evidence or intuition) is not to mere rhetoric here or anywhere else; in the sense of the introductory part, the regress to what is ultimate in cognition signifies, instead, precisely the same thing when the word insight is used in the most primitive logical and arithmetical axioms.<sup>18</sup> But he who has learned to apprehend with insight what is &lt;158&gt; given in the sphere of consciousness will be able to read with astonishment statements such as the ones cited above: &quot;One cannot even inquire into the likelihood of how one arrives at the cognition of immediate mental living;<sup>55</sup> from this we can see how alien the eidetic analysis of the immanent still is to modern psychology, even though &lt;eidetic analysis&gt; is the uniquely possible method for fixing the concepts which have to function as determinative in all psychological description of what is immanent.<sup>19,20</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The intimate connection between phenomenology and psychology is especially tangible in the problems of reflection dealt with here. Every description of essence related to species of mental processes expresses an unconditionally valid norm for possible empirical existence. In particular, this naturally concerns as well all the species of mental processes which are themselves constitutive for the psychological method, just as that &lt;method&gt; holds for all modes of experience of the internal. Thus phenomenology is the court of appeal for &lt;159&gt; methodologically basic questions of psychology. Psychology must recognize, and if need be, rely on, what it has established generically as the condition for the possibility of all its further methods. What proves to be contradictory in that connection characterizes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">an essentially necessary psychological countersense</span><span class="font17"> in precisely the same way that, in the physical sphere, whatever contradicts the truths of geometry and the ontology of Nature taken universally is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essentially necessary countersense cf the natural sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One such essentially necessary countersense is expressed, accordingly, in the hope of overcoming the skeptical doubts about the possibility of self-observation by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">psychological induction</span><span class="font17"> in the ways of experimental psychology. Again, it is like the case in the domain of the cognition of physical nature where one would overcome by experimental physics the parallel skepticism about whether it is not the case that ultimately every perception of something external is deceptive (since, indeed, taken singly, each actual perception can deceive) when in fact the legitimacy of perception of something external is presupposed at every step.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Moreover, what is said here in universality will gain in force by everything which follows, in particular by the clarifications of the range of reflectional eidetic insights. The relations touched upon here between phenomenology (or between eidetic psychology, which has not even been separated form phenomenology in a preliminary way, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">came to mewhile this book was in press, shows again how little even significant investigators have succeeded in freeing themselves from the bonds of the dominant prejudices and, while sympathetic to the efforts of phenomenology, howlittlethey havesucceeded inapprehending the own specific characteristics of phenomenology as a <sup>t&lt;</sup>^A^oryo/zJJ^^.^<sup>5</sup> Both, and especially Messer (even in his earlier &lt;( 1912)&gt; critical statements in </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Archiv/ d. ges.

<p><span class="font17">and which in any case is intimately tied up with phenomenology) and psychology as an experiential science will also be subject to clarification in the Second Book with all the profound problems pertaining to it I am certain that in the not too distant future it will be a common conviction that phenomenology (or eidetic psychology) will be the methodologically foundational science for empirical psychology in the same sense that the material mathematical disciplines (e.g., geometry and phoronomy) are foundational for physics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The old ontological doctrine </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">that the cognition of ^possibilities&quot; must precede the cognition of actualities</span><span class="font17"> is, in my opinion, in so far as it is correctly understood and made useful in the right ways, a great truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§80 . The Relationship of Mental Processes to the Pure Ego.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Among the universal essential peculiarities pertaining to the transcendentally purified realm of mental processes the first place is due the relationship of each mental process to the &quot;pure&quot; Ego. Each &lt;160&gt; &quot;cogito,&quot; each act in a distinctive sense, is characterized as an act of the Ego, it ''proceeds from out of the Ego/<sup>5</sup> it <sup>&lt;^</sup>lives^^ <sup>&lt;^</sup>actionally^^ in the act. We have already spoken about this and will recall in a few sentences what was previously elaborated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">While observing, / perceive something; in a like manner/am often &quot;busied&quot; with something in memory; while quasi-observing, /follow in inventive phantasy what goes on in the phantasied world. Or I reflect, I draw conclusions; I take back a judgment, perchance &quot;abstaining&quot; from making any judgments at all. I am pleased or displeased, I am glad or sad, I wish, or I will and I do&lt;something&gt;; or, again, I &quot;abstain&quot; from being glad, from wishing, willing and doing. In all such acts I am present, I am </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actionally</span><span class="font17"> there.

<p><span class="font17">We spoke before of mental processes of the particular type <sup>4&lt;</sup>cogi-to.&quot; The other mental processes, which form the universal milieu for the Ego-actionality, to be sure, lack the distinctive Ego-relatedness which we have just mentioned. And yet they also have their share in the pure Ego and the pure Ego has its share in them. They &quot;belong&quot; to &lt;the pure Ego&gt; as &quot;its own&quot; &lt;mental processes,&gt; they are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its </span><span class="font17">consciousness-background, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font17"> field of freedom.</span></p>

And, again: &lt;there are always distinguished&gt; the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely subjective moments of the mode of consciousness</span><span class="font17"> and, so to speak, the rest of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">content&quot; the mental process turned away from the Ego.</span><span class="font17"> As a consequence, there is a certain, extraordinarily important two-sidedness in the essence of the sphere of mental processes, of which we can also say that in mental processes there is to be distinguished a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">subjectively orientecP<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font17"> side and an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">objectively oriented</span><span class="font17"> side: a manner of expression which must not be understood, indeed, as if we taught that the &quot;Object&quot; of the mental processes were something in it analogous to the pure Ego. The manner of expression will nevertheless be justified. And we add at once that to this two-sidedness, at least in significant stretches, there</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">corresponds a division of the investigation (if not an actual separation), one part of which is oriented toward pure subjectivity, the other part toward what belongs to the &quot;constitution'' of Objectivity </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font17"> the subjectivity. We shall have a great deal to say about the &quot;intentional relation&quot; of mental processes (or of the pure Ego living in them) to Objects, and about the many sorts of mental processcomponents and &quot;intentional correlates&quot; which belong together with &lt;that relation&gt;. But all of these can be explored and described analytically or synthetically in comprehensive investigations without having to be occupied in any more profound way with the pure Ego and its modes of participation. Of course, frequently one must touch upon the pure Ego in so far as the pure Ego is something necessarily involved there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The meditations which we intend to carry out further in this Part give preference to the objectively oriented side as that which offers itself in the first place when starting from the natural attitude. The problems indicated in the introductory paragraphs of this Part already refer to this</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">objectively oriented side&gt;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§81 . Phenomenological Time and Consciousness &quot;&nbsp;Time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">A proper discussion is required by phenomenological time as a universal peculiarity of all mental processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We must carefully observe the distinction between this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenological time,</span><span class="font17"> this unitary form of all mental processes within </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> stream of mental processes (within </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> pure Ego), and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^objective/<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font17"> i.e., the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">cosmic</span><span class="font7"> 万加</span><span class="font17">c.24</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">162</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">By means of the phenomenological reduction consciousness has not only lost<sup>25</sup> its apperceptive &quot;attachement&quot; (which, of course, is a metaphor) to material reality and its incorporation into space, even though this is secondary, but also its place in cosmic time. That time which, by virtue of its essence belongs to the mental process as mental process, with its modes of givenness of Now, Before, After, with their modally determined simultaneity and recession, etc., is not measured nor to be measured by any position of the sun, by any clock, by any physical means .</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Cosmic time is related to phenomenological time in a certain way analogous to the way in which a &quot;spread&quot; belonging to the imma-nental </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of a concrete sensation-content (perhaps a visual sensation-content in the field of visual sensation-Data) is related to objective spatial &quot;extension,&quot; namely &lt;the &quot;extension&quot;</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">of the appearing physical Object being visually &quot;adumbrated&quot; in this sensation-Datum. Just as it would be countersensical to subordinate a sensation-moment, such as color or spread, under the same essential genus with the physical moment, such as the color of the physical thing and the physical extension, adumbrated &lt;by the sensationDatum&gt;: so the same would be the case with regard to the phenomenologically temporal and the worldly temporal. Transcendent time can be presented by way of appearance in the mental process and its components; but of essential necessity it makes no sense here as elsewhere to suppose a metaphorical similarity between the presentation and the presented which, as similarity, would presuppose oneness of essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In addition, it should not be said, for instance, that the way in which cosmic time is manifested in phenomenological time is precisely the same way in which other, material-essential moments of the world are phenomenologically presented. Certainly the presenting of colors and other sensuous qualities of physical things (in corresponding sense Data pertaining to sense-fields) is essentially different in kind; and, again, the adumbrating of spatial shapes of physical things in the forms of spread within Data of sensation is different in kind. But in what was worked out above commonality exists everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Moreover, as will emerge from investigations to follow later on, time is a name for a completely </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">delimited sphere of problems</span><span class="font17"> and one of exceptional difficulty. It will be shown that in order to avoid confusion our previous presentation has remained silent to a certain extent, and must of necessity remain silent about what first of all is alone visible in the phenomenological attitude and which, disregarding the new dimension, makes up a closed domain of investigation.</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">163</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">rhe transcendentally &quot;absolute&quot; which we have brought about by the reductions is, in truth, not what is ultimate; it is something which constitutes itself in a certain profound and completely peculiar sense of its own and which has its primal source in what is ultimately and truly absolute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Fortunately we can leave out of account the enigma of conscious-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ness of time<sup>26</sup> in our preliminary analyses without endangering their rigor. In the following sentences we only touch upon it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The essential property, which the term temporality expresses for any mental process whatever, not only designates something universally belonging to every single mental process, but also a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessary form combining mental processes with mental processes^<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font17"> Each actual mental process (we effect this evidence on the ground of clear intuition of an actuality characterizing mental processes) is necessarily an enduring one; and with this duration it finds its place in an infinite continuum of duration ——in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fulfilled</span><span class="font17"> continuum. Of necessity it has an allround, infinitely fulfilled temporal horizon. At the same time this says: it belongs to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> endless </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^stream of mental processes .^</span><span class="font17"> Every single mental process, e.g., a mental process ofjoy, can begin as well as end and hence delimit its duration. But the stream of mental processes cannot begin and end. Every mental process, as temporal being, is a mental process of its pure Ego. Belonging of necessity to this is the possibility (which, as we know, is no empty logical possibility) that the Ego directs its pure regard to this mental process and seizes upon &lt;the mental process&gt; as actually existing or as enduring in phenomenological time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But, again, there belongs to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of the situation the possibility that the Ego directs its regard to the temporal </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">modes of givenness</span><span class="font17"> and knows with evidence (as we all in fact acquire this evidence by reliving what is described in intuition) that no enduring mental process is possible unless it is constituted in a continuous flow of modes of givenness as something unitary pertaining to the event and to the duration; moreover, &lt;it knows with evidenco that this mode of givenness of the temporal mental process is itself again a mental </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">164</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">process, although of a new kind and dimension. Thus, for instance, I can have, first of all, in the pure regard thejoy itself which begins and ends and endures in the meantime; I go along with its temporal phases. However, I can take heed of its modes of givenness: I take heed, in the particular case, of the mode of &quot;Now&quot; and accordingly of the fact that a new and continually new &lt;Now&gt; follows upon this Now and,ofessential necessity, upon every &lt;Now&gt; in necessary continuity, of the fact that in unity therewith every actually present Now is chan-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ged into a Just Now, the Just Now once more and continuously into an always new Just Now of thejust Now; and so forth. This holds for every new ensuing Now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The actually present </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Now</span><span class="font17"> is necessarily and remains something punctual, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">a persisting form for ever new material.</span><span class="font17"> It is likewise with the continuity of &quot;just now;' it is a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">continuity &quot;&nbsp;forms</span><span class="font17"> of always new contents. At the same time this signifies: the enduring mental process of joy is given &quot;in the manner peculiar to consciousness&quot; in a consciousness-continuum of constant </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">form:</span><span class="font17"> A phase, impression, as the limit-phase of a continuity of retentions which, however, are not on an equal footing; they are instead </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">to be related to one another continuously-intentively ——</span><span class="font17">a continuous complexity of retentions of retentions. The form always contains a new content, thus continuously &quot;attaches&quot; to each impression in which the Now of the mental process is given, a new &lt;impression&gt; corresponding continuously to a new point of the duration; an impression continuously changes into a retention; this retention continuously changes into a modified retention; and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To this must be added the counter-direction of continuous changes: to the Before there corresponds the After; to the continuum of retentions there corresponds that of protentions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§82 . Continuation. The Threefold Horizon of Mental Processes As At The Same Time the Horizon of Reflection On Mental Processes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">But we also know still more in this connection. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Each</span><span class="font17"> Now of the mental process, be it even the beginning phase of a newly appearing mental process, necessarily has its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">horizon of Before.</span><span class="font17"> But of essential necessity that cannot be an empty Before, an empty form without content, a non-sense. Of necessity it has the signification of a past Now which comprises in this form a past something, a past </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mental process.</span><span class="font17"> Every mental process which has newly begun is of necessity temporally preceded by mental processes; the past of mental processes is continuously fulfilled. However, every Now of the mental process also has its necessary </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">horizon cf After,</span><span class="font17"> and that is also not an empty horizon; of necessity every Now of the mental process, even ifit &lt;165&gt; is the end-phase of duration pertaining to a mental process which is ceasing, changes into a new Now, and it is of necessity a fulfilled one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In that connection, one can also say: Of necessity there is attached</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">to the consciousness of Now the consciousness of the just past, the consciousness of which is itself again a Now. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">No mental process can cease without there being consciousness &quot;&nbsp;the ceasing and of the having ceased,</span><span class="font17"> and that is a newly filled out Now. The stream of mental processes is an infinite unity, and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">stream-form</span><span class="font17"> is a form which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessarily comprises all mental processes pertaining to a pure Ego</span><span class="font17"> — a &lt;fbrm&gt; with a variety of systems of forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We reserve for future expositions, already announced, the more precise elaboration of these insights and the pointing out of their great metaphysical consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The universal peculiarities of mental processes just dealt with, as possible data of reflective (immanental) perception, are a component part of a still more comprehensive peculiarity which is stated in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic law</span><span class="font17"> that every mental process in an essentially self-enclosed concatenation of mental processes is not only considered in view of temporal </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">succession</span><span class="font17"> but in view of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">simultaneity.</span><span class="font17"> That means that every </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Now</span><span class="font17"> of a mental process has a horizon of mental processes which also have precisely the originary form of &quot;Now&quot; and, as &quot;Now J make up </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">an originary horizon of the pure Ego,</span><span class="font17"> its total originary </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Now</span><span class="font17"> of consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In a unitary way this horizon enters into the modes of the past. As a modified Now, every Before implies for every mental process in view, whose Before it is, an infinite horizon embracing everything which belongs to the same modified Now; in short, it embraces its horizon of &quot;what was simultaneously.<sup>,5</sup> The descriptions given a little while ago are therefore to be supplemented by a new dimension, and only when we do that do we have the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">whole</span><span class="font17"> field of phenomenological time of the pure Ego —&lt;a field&gt; which, from any one of &quot;its” mental processes, it can traverse according to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font17"> dimensions of Earlier, Later, and Simultaneity; or, in other words, we have the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">whole, essentially unified </span><span class="font17">and strictly self-contained </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">stream</span><span class="font17"> of temporal unities of mental processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">One</span><span class="font17"> pure Ego — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> stream of mental processes fulfilled with respect to all three dimensions, essentially concatenated in this fulfilling, summoning itself in its continuity of content: these are necessary correlates.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;166&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">To this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">primal form of consciousness</span><span class="font17"> the following is related by eidetic law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When the pure regard of the Ego reaches any mental process by reflecting and, more particularly, by seizing upon it perceptually, the possibility then exists of the regard turning toward other mental processes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">asfar as</span><span class="font17"> this concatenation reaches. But by essential necessity this whole concatenation is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font17"> given or to be given by a single pure regard. In spite of this, it also can be seized upon intuitively in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">certain,</span><span class="font17"> albeit essentially different way; &lt;the whole can be seized upon&gt; in the fashion of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^limitlessness in the progression^</span><span class="font17"> of intuitions of the immanent going from the fixed mental process to new mental processes pertaining to its horizon of mental processes, from its fixing to those of its horizons; etc. The term </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">horizon of mental processes</span><span class="font17"> not only signifies here, however, the horizon of phenomenological temporality according to its described dimensions, but also differences in novel modes of givenness. Accordingly, a mental process which has become an Object of an Ego-regard, which therefore has the mode of being made an object of regard, has its horizon of unregarded mental processes; a mental process seized upon in a mode of &quot;attention&quot; and possibly in unceasing clarity, has a horizon of inattention in the background with relative differences of clarity and obscurity as well as salientness and lack of salientness. Eidetic possibilities are rooted therein: &lt;the eidetic possibility&gt; of making the unregarded an object of the pure regard, of making the marginally noticed the primally noticed; of the making of the unsalient salient, the obscure clear and always clearer.<sup>28</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the continuous progression from seizing-upon to seizing-upon, in a certain way, I said, we now seize upon the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">stream of mental processes </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">s </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unity.</span><span class="font17"> We do not seize upon it as we do a single mental process but rather in the manner of an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">idea in the Kantian sense.</span><span class="font17"> It is not something posited or affirmed by chance; it is instead an absolutely indubitable givenness. Even though it is also grounded in intuition, this indubita-bility has a source entirely different from that which exists for the being of mental processes, which therefore becomes given in the perception of the immanent. It is precisely the peculiarity of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ideation which sees a Kantian &quot;idea&quot; that it does not on that &lt;167&gt; account, perhaps, lose the insight because the adequate determination of its content, here the stream of mental processes, is unattainable. At the same time we see that a series of distinguishable modes of givenness belongs to the stream of mental processes and its components —a series of modes of givenness the systematic inquiry into which must form a chief task of universal phenomenology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the basis of our considerations we can also formulate the eidetically valid and evidential statement that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">no concrete mental process </span><span class="font17">can be accepted as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">self-sufficient one in thefull sense.</span><span class="font17"> Each is &quot;in need of supplementation^^ with respect to a prescribed concatenation, which is therefore not arbitrary according to its kind and form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">E.g.: We observe any perception of something external, let us say of this determined perception of a house taken in concrete fullness; there then belongs to this perception the surroundings of mental processes as a necessary determinational part; however, it is, to be sure, a specifically peculiar, necessary and yet </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^extra-essential</span><span class="font17"> determinational part, namely that determinational part the change of which alters nothing in the essential contents </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">proper</span><span class="font17"> to the mental process.<sup>29</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Thus perception itself changes according to change in determinedness of the surroundings,</span><span class="font17"> while the ultimate specific difierences of the genus Perception, its inner ownness, can be conceived as identical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">That, in this ownness, two essentially identical perceptions are also identical with respect to the determination of the surroundings, is of essential necessity impossible for they would then be individually </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font17">perception.<sup>30</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In any case, one can make that evident with respect to two perceptions and therefore to any two mental processes whatever which belong to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> stream of mental processes. Every mental process influences the (bright or dark) halo of further mental processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A more precise consideration would show, besides, that two </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">streams of</span><span class="font17"> mental processes (spheres of consciousness for two pure Egos)</span><span class="font7">必 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">an identically essential content are inconceivable,</span><span class="font17"> as well that no </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">completely determined</span><span class="font17"> mental process of the one stream can belong to the other —— which can be seen from what has been said before; only mental processes of an identical inner characteristic can be common to them</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">(although not common as individually identical), but not two<sup>31 </sup>mental processes which, in addition, have a &quot;halo'' absolutely alike.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§84 . Intentionality as Principal Theme ^Phenomenology</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">We now pass over to a peculiarity of mental processes, to intentionality, which one can directly designate as the general theme of^Objec-tively^^ oriented phenomenology.<sup>32</sup> Intentionality is an essential &lt;168&gt; peculiarity of the sphere of mental processes taken universally in so far as all mental processes in some manner or other share in it; nevertheless, we cannot say </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ofeach</span><span class="font17"> mental process that it has intentionality in the same sense as when we say, e.g., of each mental process, even if it is an abstract moment of the mental process entering as Object into the regard of possible reflection, that it is a temporal &lt;mental process&gt;. Intentionality is what characterizes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consciousness</span><span class="font17"> in the pregnant sense and which, at the same time, justifies designating the whole stream of mental processes as the stream of consciousness and as the unity of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the preliminary eidetic analyses of the Second Part concerning consciousness in its universality (still at the entrance gate to phenomenology and, more particularly, for the goal of acquiring it by the method of the reduction) it was already necessary to work out a series of the most universal determinations concerning any intentionality whatever and concerning the distinctiveness of &quot;acts,&quot; of the &quot;cogi-tatio.''33 We have made further use of them, and had to do so even though the original analyses were still not carried out under the explicit norm of the &lt;transcendental&gt; phenomenological reduction. Because they concern the pure essence proper of mental processes, they cannot, as a consequence, be touched by the excluding of the psychological apperception and positing of being. Since it is now a matter of explaining </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intentionality as a comprehensive name for all-inclusive phenomenological structures,</span><span class="font17"> and to sketch the sets of problems essentially related to these structures (in so far as that is possible in a general introduction), we shall recapitulate what we said earlier but in a form required by our goals which now have an essentially different direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Under intentionality we understand the own peculiarity of men tai processes &quot;to be consciousness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font17"> something.<sup>5,</sup> We first of all encounter this marvelous ownness, back to which all rational-theoretical and metaphysical enigmas lead, in the explicit </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">cogito:</span><span class="font17"> a perceiving is a perceiving of something, perhaps a physical thing; a judging is a judging of a predicatively formed affair-complex; valuing of a predicatively formed value-complex; a wishing of a predicatively formed wish-complex; and so forth. Acting bears upon action. Doing bears upon the deed, loving bears upon the loved one, being glad bears upon the gladsome</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> and so forth. In every actional cogito a &lt;169&gt; radiating &quot;regard&quot; is directed from the pure Ego to the &quot;object&quot; of the consciousness-correlate in question, to the physical thing, to the a flair-complex, etc., and effects the very different kinds of consciousness &quot;it. However, now, phenomenological reflection teaches that this objectivating, thinking, valuing ... Ego-advertence, this being-busied-with-the-correlate-object </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actionally^</span><span class="font17"> this being-directed-to-it (or also away from it — and yet with the regard upon it) is not to be found in every mental process: even so &lt;the mental process&gt; can still include intentionality within itself. Thus it is clear, for instance, that the objective background, from out of which the cognitively perceived object is singled out by virtue of the fact that the distinctive Ego-advertence is allocated to it, is, as a mental process, actually an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">objective</span><span class="font17"> background. That is, while we are now adverted to the pure object in the mode of &quot;cogito,&quot; all sorts of objects &quot;appear;&quot; they are &quot;intended to” intuitively, they flow together into the intuitive unity of a conscious field of objects. It is a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">potential field cf perception</span><span class="font17"> in the sense that a particular perceiving (an attentive cogito) can advert to something which thus appears; but not in the sense as though the sensation-adumbrations present as a mental process, e.g., the visual &lt;sensation-adumbrations&gt; spread out in the unity of the visual sensation-field, lack any objective construing and therefore only constitute intuitive appearances of objects with the adverting of the regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There belong here, moreover, mental processes of the actionality-background, such as the &quot;arousal&quot; oflikings, of judgments, of wishes, etc., at different distances in the background or, as we can also say, at a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">distance from</span><span class="font17"> and a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">nearness to the</span><span class="font7"> 磁</span><span class="font17">o, since the actional pure Ego living in the particular cogitationes is the point of reference.

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">On Terminology</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen</span><span class="font17"> precisely this something universal is designated as &quot;act-characteristic&quot; and every concrete mental process of this characteristic as &quot;act.&quot; The continual misinterpretations which this concept of act has undergone has decided me (here as in lectures for a number of years back) to delimit the terminology somewhat more cautiously and no longer to use the expressions act and intentive mental process as equivalent without taking precautions. The sequel will establish the fact that my original concept of act is everywhere quite indispensable, but that it is continually necessary to take into account the modal differences between acts which are and are not effected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When nothing is added, and we speak simply of act, we mean exclusively the genuine, so to speak, actionally effected acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Moreover, we must note quite universally that in phenomenology, at the beginning, all concepts or terms must remain in flux in a certain way, always at the point of being differentiated in accord with the progress of the analysis of consciousness and the cognition of new phenomenological strata within what is at first seen in undifferentiated unity. All terms chosen have their tendencies of being connected &lt;with other terms&gt;; they refer to relational directions, of which it is afterwards brought out that they do not have their source only in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> essence-stratum; as a result, it is better to limit or otherwise to modify the terminology at the same time. Therefore we can only count on definitive terminologies at a very advanced stage of deve-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">lopment of a science. It is an error and basically absurd to apply extrinsic and formal criteria of a logic of terminology to scientific expositions which arejust emerging and to demand terminologies of the sort which fix the concluding results of great scientific developments at the beginning. For the beginning, any expression is good and, more particularly, any suitably chosen figurative expression which enables us to guide our regard to a phenomenological occurrence which can be seized upon clearly. Clarity does not exclude a certain halo of indeterminateness. Its further determination or clarification is precisely the futher task just as is, on the other hand, the internal analysis carried out by comparisons or by varying the &lt;171&gt; contexts: the dividing up into components or strata. Those who, dissatisfied with the intuitive demonstrations, demand &quot;definitions'' as in the &quot;exact” sciences or who believe that they can easily get along in a non-intuitive scientific thinking and thereby advance phenomenology with phenomenological concepts acquired from rough analyses of a couple of examples and which they assume to be fixed, are but beginners who have not yet even grasped the essence of phenomenology and the method essentially and necessarily required by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What has just been said is true no less for the empirically oriented psychological phenomenology in the sense of a description of psychological phenomena which is attached to what essentially pertains to the immanent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The concept of intentionality, apprehended in its undetermined range, as we have apprehended it, is a wholly indispensable fundamental concept which is the starting point at the beginning of phenomenology. The universality which it designates may be ever so vague prior to more precise investigation; it may enter into an ever so great plurality of essentially different formations; it may be ever so difficult to set forth in rigorous and clear analyses what makes up the pure essence of intentionality, which components of the concrete formations genuinely contain it in themselves and to which &lt;components&gt; it is intrinsically alien ——in any case, mental processes are observed from a determined and highly important point of view when we cognize them as intentive and say of them that they are consciousness of something. It is, moreover, indifferent to us in such assertions whether concrete mental processes of abstract strata of mental processes are involved: for they can also show the peculiarity in question.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">We already suggested above, when we characterized the stream of mental processes as a unity of consciousness, that intentionality, disregarding its enigmatic forms and levels, is also like a universal medium which ultimately bears in itself all mental processes, even those which are not themselves characterized as intentive. At the level of consideration to which we are confined until further notice, a level which abstains from descending into the obscure depths of the ultimate consciousness which constitutes all such temporality as belongs to mental processes,<sup>35</sup> and instead takes mental processes as they offer themselves as unitary temporal processes in reflection on what is immanent, we must, however, essentially distinguish two things:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the mental processes designated in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen</span><span class="font17"> &lt;1 72&gt; as &quot;primary contents;<sup>,</sup></span><span class="font11"><sup>)</sup></span><span class="font17"><sup>36</sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mental processes or their moments which bear in themselves the specific trait of intentionality.<sup>37</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Among the former belong certain </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^sensuous&quot;</span><span class="font17"> mental processes which are unitary with respect to their highest genus, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>(&lt;</sup>sensationcontents&quot;</span><span class="font17"> such as color-Data, touch-Data and tone-Data, and the like, which we shall no longer confuse with appearing moments of physical things </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">coloredness, roughness, etc. — which &quot;present themselves&quot; to mental processes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">\erlebnismafiig\</span><span class="font17"> by means of those &lt;&quot;con-tents'U. Likewise the sensuous pleasure, pain and tickle sensations, and so forth, and no doubt also sensuous moments belonging to the sphere of &quot;drives.&quot; We find such concrete really immanental Data as components in more inclusive concrete mental processes which are intentive as wholes; and, more particularly, we find those sensuous moments overlaid by a stratum which, as it were</span><span class="font7">「</span><span class="font17">animates J which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">bestows sense</span><span class="font17"> (or essentially involves a bestowing of sense) — a stratum by which precisely the concrete intentive mental process arises from the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sensuous, which</span><span class="font17"> £</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">s </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in itself nothing pertaining to intentionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Whether everywhere and necessarily such sensuous mental processes in the stream of mental processes bear some ''animating cons-truing^^ or other (with all the characteristics which this, in turn, demands and makes possible), whether, as we also say, they always have </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intentivefunctions,</span><span class="font17"> is not to be decided here. On the other hand, we likewise leave it undecided at first if the characteristics essentially making up intentionality can have concreteness without having sensuous foundations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Be that as it may, this remarkable duality and unity </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of sensuous </span><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">dXt| </span><span class="font17">and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intentive</span><span class="font7"> 诔</span><span class="font17">0</span><span class="font7">。中耳 </span><span class="font17">plays a dominant role in the whole phenomenological sphere. In fact these concepts of stuff and form force themselves upon us if we presentiate to ourselves any clear intuitions or clearly effected valuations, acts of liking, willings, or the like. The intentive mental processes are there as unities by virtue of sensebestowing (in a greatly extended sense). Sensuous Data present themselves as stuffs for intentive formings, or sense-bestowings, belonging to difierent levels, for simple formings and formings which &lt;&nbsp;173&gt; are founded in a peculiar manner; we shall return to this in greater detail. That these locutions are very fitting will be confirmed from another side by the doctrine of &quot;correlates.'' As for the possibilities left open above, they should be entitled accordingly </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formless stuff's</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">stuffless forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With respect to terminology, the following may be added. The expression, primary content, no longer appears to us sufficiently characteristic. On the other hand, the expression, sensuous mental process, cannot be used for the same concept because general locutions such as sensuous perceptions, sensuous intuitions of every sort, sensuous gladness, and the like, stand in the way — locutions characterizing as sensuous intentive mental processes rather than bare hyletic processes; owing to its new ambiguities, the locution, &quot;bare,&quot; or &quot;pure,&quot; sensuous processes, obviously would not improve the matter. In addition there are the peculiar ambiguities belonging to the word &quot;sensuous&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[<sup>cc</sup>sinnlich<sup>}&gt;</sup>],</span><span class="font17"> which are retained after the phenomenological reduction. Apart from the double sense which surfaces in the contrast between &quot;sense-bestowing&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[<sup>cc</sup>sinngebencT&quot;]</span><span class="font17"> and &quot;sensuous&quot; and which, disturbing as it occasionally is, can hardly be avoided, the following should be mentioned: sensuousness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Sinnlich^ keit]</span><span class="font17"> in a narrower sense designates the phenomenological residuum of what is conveyed by the &quot;senses&quot; in normal perception of the external. After the reduction there becomes apparent an essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">kinship among the remaining &quot;sensuous&quot; Data of intuitions of the external; and to it corresponds a peculiar generic essence, correla-tivcly a fundamental concept of phenomenology. In the broader and essentially unitary sense, however, sensuousness also comprises the sensuous feelings and drives which have their own generic unity and, on the other side, no doubt likewise an essential kinship of a general sort with the aforesaid sensuousness in the narrower sense — all that regardless of the additional community expressed by the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">functional </span><span class="font17">concept ofhyle. Together, both compelled the old transference of the orignially narrow term sensuousness to the spheres of emotion and will, namely to the intentive mental processes in which sensuous Data belonging to the designated spheres make their appearance as functioning &quot;stuffk&quot; Be that as it may. therefore, we need a new term which expresses the whole group by the unity of the function and the contrast to the forming characteristics; and we choose for it the expression </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">hyletic Data</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">stuff-Data,</span><span class="font17"> likewise simply </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sensuous stuffs. </span><span class="font17">Where it is necessary to awaken the memory of the old expressions, unavoidable in their way, we shall speak of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sensual,</span><span class="font17"> indeed even </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sensuous stuff [sensuelle, wohl auch sinnliche Stoffe].</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What forms the stuff into intentive mental processes and what &lt;&nbsp;174&gt; brings in that which is specific to intentionality is precisely the same thing as what gives the locution, consciousness, its specific sense: precisely according to which consciousness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eo ipso</span><span class="font17"> indicates something of which it is consiousness.<sup>38</sup> Because, now, the locutions, moments of consciousness, awarenesses, and similar constructions, and likewise because the locution, intentive moments, are made quite unusable by the many diflerent equivocations which will be distinctly brought out in what follows, we introduce the term </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noetic moment</span><span class="font17"> or, in short, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noesis.</span><span class="font17"> These noeses make up what is specific to </span><span class="font7">几</span><span class="font17">o</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">s </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the broadest sense</span><span class="font17"> of the word; it refers us back, according to all its actional life-forms, to cogitationes and then to any intentive mental processes whatever^ and as a result comprises everything (and essentially only that) which is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic presupposition of the idea of the norm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At the same time, it is not unwelcome that the word, nous, recalls one ofits distinctive significations, namely precisely </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;sense</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> although the “sense-bestowing&quot; which is efiected in the noetic moments comprises many different things and only as foundation &lt;comprises&gt; a &quot;sense-bestowing&quot; following upon [he pregnant concept of sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There would be good grounds for designating this noetic side of mental processes as the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">psychical</span><span class="font17"> side. This is because the regard of the philosophical psychologists was directed, with a certain perference, in the locutions of </span><span class="font7">皿酒 </span><span class="font17">ancl the psychical to what &lt;the locution&gt; intentionality introduces, while the sensuous moments were predicated of the organism and its sensuous activities.<sup>39</sup> This old tendency has found its most recent expression in Brentano's differentiation of &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;psychical&quot; phenomena. It is especially significant because the &lt;differentiation&gt; blazed the trail for the development of phenomenology </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">although Brentano himself still remained far from the phenomenological standpoint, and although he did not encounter with his differentiation what he really searched for: namely the differentiation of the realm of experience pertaining to the physical natural sciences from psychology. What is of special concern for us here is only the following: Brentano, more particularly, still did not find the concept of stuff-moments ——and this is because he did not take account of the differentiation between the &quot;physical phenomena” as stuff-moments (sensation-Data) and &quot;physical phenomena” as objective moments (physical color, physical shape, and the like) appearing in the noetic apprehension of the </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">175</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">former — in contradistinction, on the other side he characterizes the concept of &quot;psychical phenomena” in one of its delimiting determinations by the peculiarity of intentionality. Precisely as a result he brought the &quot;psychical&quot; into the sphere of vision of our times in that distinctive sense which had a certain emphasis but was not annuled in the historical signification of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But what speaks against the use of the term as equivalent to intentionality is the circumstance that, without doubt, it is not suitable to designate in the same way the psychical in this sense &lt;scl. intentionality&gt; and the psychical in the sense of the psychological (therefore of that which is the peculiar Object of psychology). Moreover, in view of this latter concept we also have the disagreeable ambiguity which has its source in the familiar tendency toward a &quot;psychology without a soul.&quot; Belonging together with that is the fact that under the heading of the psychical — especially of the actual psychical in contrast to the corresponding &quot;psychical dispositions&quot;— one preferably thinks of mental processes in the unity of the empirically<sup>40</sup> posited stream of mental processes. But it is now unavoidable</span></p>

<p><span class="font17"><sub>t0</sub> designate as Object of psychology, as also the psychical, the real bearers of this psychical, the animate beings, or their &quot;souls'' and their psychically real properties. The ''psychology without a soul&quot; confuses, as it would seem to us, the exclusion of the soul-entity, in the sense of some sort of nebulous metaphysics of the soul, with the exclusion of the soul taken universally, i.e., the psychical reality factually given in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">empeiria,</span><span class="font17"> the states of which are mental processes. By <sub>n</sub>o means is this reality the mere stream of men tai processes inseparable from the organism and empirically governed in certain ways, for which dispositional concepts are mere indices to their regularities. Nevertheless, the presence of equivocations and, above all, the circumstance that the dominant concepts of the psychical do not bear upon the specifically intentional, make the term unsuitable for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We therefore retain the term </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noetic</span><span class="font17"> and say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The stream of phenomenological being has a stuff-stratum and a noetic stratum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Phenomenological considerations and analyses which specifically concern stuff can be termed </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">hyletic-phenomenological</span><span class="font17"> onesjust as, on the other hand, those relative to the noetic moments can be termed </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noetic-phenomenological</span><span class="font17"> considerations and analyses.

<p><span class="font17">Nonetheless, the greatest problems of all are the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Junctional problems,</span><span class="font17"> or those of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^constitution of consciousness-objectivities.<sup>9,</sup></span><span class="font17"> &lt;These problems&gt; concern the way in which noeses, e.g., with respect to Nature, by animating stuff and combining it into manifold-unitary continua and syntheses bring about consciousness of something such that the Objective unity of the objectivity allows of being harmoniously &quot;made known J &quot;legitimated&quot; and &quot;rationally&quot; determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this sense </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">function^</span><span class="font17"> (in an entirely different sense in contrast to the mathematical one) is something wholly unique, grounded in the pure </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of noesis. Consciousness is precisely consciousness &quot;oF' something; it is of its essence to bear in itself &quot;sense,'' so to speak, the quintessence of &quot;soul,'' &quot;spirit,'' &quot;reason.'' Consciousness is not a name for &quot;psychical complexes/<sup>5</sup> for &quot;contents'' fused together, for</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“bundles'' or streams of “sensations&quot; which, without sense in themselves, also cannot lend any <sup>t&lt;</sup>sense^^ to whatever mixture; it is rather through and through “consciousness J the source of all reason and unreason, all legitimacy and illegitimacy, all reality and fiction, all value and disvalue, all deed and misdeed. Consciousness is therefore to to coelo different from what sensualism<sup>42</sup> alone will see, from what in fact is irrational stuff without sense — but which is, of course, accessible to rationalization. We shall soon learn to better understand what rationalization signifies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The point of view of function is the central one for phenomenology; the investigations radiating from it suitably comprise the whole phenomenological sphere, and, finally, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> phenomenological analyses in some manner or other enter into its service as component parts or preliminary stages. In place of analysis and comparison, description and classification restricted to single particular mental processes, consideration arises of single particularities from the <sup>u</sup>teleologi-cal&quot; point of view of their function, of making possible a “synthetical unity.&quot; Of essential necessity the consideration turns to the multiplicities of consciousness, predelineated, so to speak, in or, as it were, extracted from, the mental processes themselves, their noeses of whatever sort: thus, e.g., in the sphere of experience and experimental thinking, &lt;the consideration turns to&gt; the multiformed continua of consciousness and the discontinuous connections of consciousnessprocesses which are connected in themselves by belonging to concatenations of sense by means of the unitarily encompassing conscious-</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">177</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">ness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font17"> one and the same Objective something, sometimes appearing in this way, sometimes in that way, being given intuitively or being conceptually determined. &lt;The consideration&gt; seeks to inquire into how something self-identical, how Objective unities of any kind which are not really immanental are “intended to J “meant;'' how consciousness-formations of very different and yet essentially required structures belong to the identity of the meant, and how these formations are to be strictly described which respect to method. Moreover, &lt;the consideration&gt; seeks to inquire into how, corresponding to the double heading of <sup>t&lt;</sup>reason^^ and <sup>t&lt;</sup>unreason,^^ the unity of the objectivity of any objective region and category can and must be “legitimated'' and “rejected J how it can and must be determined in the forms of consciousness, more “precisely&quot; determined or deter-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">mined &quot;otherwise,&quot; or be entirely rejected as &quot;null,&quot; &quot;illusion.&quot; In that context all distinctions are accordingly subsumed under the trivial and yet so paradoxical headings of &quot;actuality&quot; and &quot;illusion,'' &quot;true'' reality, &quot;illusion-reality,&quot; &quot;true&quot; values, ^illusory value and disvalue,&quot; the phenomenological clarification of which follows upon &lt;these considerations&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is therefore a matter of inquiring, in the most comprehensive universality, into how Objective unities of any region and category <sub>ar</sub>e &quot;constituted in the manner peculiar to consciousness?<sup>5</sup> It is a question of systematically showing how, by its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence^</span><span class="font17"> all the concatenations of actual and possible consciousness — precisely as eidetic possibilities — are predelineated: from the simple or founded intuitions intentively related to them, the confused or clear, expressive or non-expressive, prescientific or scientific formations at lower or higher levels produced by thinking, to the highest formations of strict, theoretical science.<sup>43</sup> All of the basic kinds of possible consciousness and the variations, fusions,<sup>44</sup> syntheses of essential necessity belonging to them are a matter to be studied and made evident in eidetic universality and phenomenological purity; how &lt;these basic kinds,&gt; by their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">own peculiar</span><span class="font17"> essence predelineate all possibilities ofbeing (and impossibilities of being); how, according to absolutely fixed eidetic laws an existing object is the correlate for concatenations of consciousness ofquite determined eidetic contents, just as, conversely, the being of such concatenations is equivalent to an existing object; and that, referred to all regions ofbeing and all levels of universality down to the concretion of being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In its purely eidetic attitude &quot;excluding&quot; every sort of transcendence, on its own peculiar basis of pure consciousness, phenomenolo- &lt;&nbsp;178&gt; gy necessarily arrives at this entire complex of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">transcendental problems in </span><span class="font7">卅</span><span class="font17">e </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">specific sense^</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">on that account</span><span class="font17"> deserves the name of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">transcendental phenomenology.</span><span class="font17"> On its own peculiar basis phenomenology must come to consider mental processes not as any sort of dead fact such as &quot;content-complexes&quot; which merely exist without signifying anything, &lt;without&gt; meaning anything; nor should it consider them only with respect to elements, complexes of constructions, with respect to elements, complexes of constructions with respect to classes and subclasses;<sup>45</sup> &lt;transcendental phenomenology should&gt; instead make</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">itself master of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essentially unique set of. problems</span><span class="font17"> which mental processes offer, and offer </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely by their eidetic essence,</span><span class="font17"> as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intentive</span><span class="font17"> mental processes, as '<sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consciousness-of.

<p><span class="font17">Naturally, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure hyletic</span><span class="font17"> is subordinated to the phenomenology of transcendental consciousness. In addition, it has the characteristic of a self-contained discipline; as a self-contained discipline it has a value in itself; on the other hand, but from a functional point of view, it has signification by the fact that it provides possible gussets in the intentional weave, possible stuffs for intentive formations. Not only with regard to the difficulties which it arrives at, but also with regard to the ranking of problems from the standpoint of the idea of an absolute cognition, it obviously stands far below the noetic and functional phenomenology (both of which, moreover, are properly not to be separated).<sup>46</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17">The word, function, in the phrase &quot;psychical function,” is used by Stumpf in his important<sup>47</sup> essay for the Berlin academy<sup>48</sup> in contrast to what he calls &quot;appearance.” The distinction is meant as a psychological one, and coincides, then, with our opposition (only applied psychologically) between &quot;acts&quot; and &quot;primary contents/<sup>5</sup> It is to be noted that the terms in question in our presentation have a completely different signification when in those of the distinguished investigator. Superficial readers of both writings have confused more than once Stumpfs concept of phenomenology (as the doctrine of &quot;appearances&quot;) with ours. Stumpfs phenomenology would correspond to what was defined above as hyletic, except that our definition </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">179&gt; in its methodical sense is essentially conditioned by the encompassing frame of transcendental phenomenology. On the other hand, the idea of the hyletic eo ipso is transferred from phenomenology to the basis of an eidetic psychology which, according to our conception, would include Stumpfs &quot;phenomenology.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§87 . Preliminary Remarks.<sup>1</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">The peculiarity of the intentive mental process is easily designated in its universality</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> we all understand the expression <sup>4</sup>'consciousness of something,<sup>5,</sup> especially in ad libitum exemplifications. It is so much more difficult to purely and correctly seize upon the phenomenological essence-peculiarities corresponding to it. That this heading circumscribes a large field of painfully achieved findings and, more particularly, of eidetic findings, would seem even today alien to the majority of philosophers and psychologists (if we can judge by the literature). This is because nothing is accomplished by saying and discerning that every objectivating relates to something objectiva-ted, that every judging relates to something judged, etc. Or that, in addition, one refers to logic, theory of knowledge, ethics, with their many evidences, and now </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">designates</span><span class="font17"> these as belonging to the essence of intentionality. This is, at the same time, a very simple way of taking the phenomenological doctrine of essences as something very old, as a new name for the old logic and those disciplines which must be ranked with it. For without having seized upon the peculiar ownness of the transcendental attitude and having actually appropriated the pure phenomenological basis, one may of course use the word, phenomenology; but one does not have the matter itself. In addition, it does not suffice, let us say, to merely change the attitude, 0r to merely carry out the phenomenological reduction in order to make something like phenomenology out of pure logic. For how far logical and, in a like way, pure ontological, pure ethical, and whatever other apriori propositions one may cite, actually express something phenomenological, and to which phenomenological strata the</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">respective &lt;propositions&gt; may belong, is not obvious. On the contrary, the most difficult problems of all are hidden, &lt;problems&gt; the sense of which is naturally concealed from all those who still have no inkling of the determinative fundamental distinctions. In fact, it is (if &lt;180&gt; I may be allowed a judgment from my own experience) a long and thorny way startingfrom purely logical insights, from insights pertaining to the theory of signification, from ontological and noetical insights, likewise from the customary normative and psychological theory of knowledge, to arrive at seizing upon, in a genuine sense, the immanent-psychological and then phenomenological data, and finally to arrive at all at the concatenations of essence which make the transcendental relations intelligible apriori. Something similar is the case no matter from where we might set out on the way from objective insights to acquire phenomenological insights which essentially belong to them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>4</sup>'Consciousness of something^^ is therefore something obviously understandable ofitselfand, at the same time, highly enigmatic. The labyrinthically false paths into which the first reflections lead, easily generate a skepticism which negates the whole troublesome sphere of problems. Not a few already bar access by the fact that they cannot bring themselves to seize upon the intentive mental process, e.g., the perceptual process, with the essence proper to it as perceptual process. Rather than living in the perception, adverted to the perceived in considering and theorizing they do not manage to direct the regard instead to the perceiving, or to the own peculiarities of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mode</span><span class="font17"> of givenness of the perceived, and to take what is offered in analysis of something immanent with respect to its essence, just as it is given. If the right attitude has been won, and made secure by practice, above all, however, if one has acquired the courage to obey the clear eidetic data with a radical lack of prejudice so as to be unencumbered by all current and learned theories, then firm results are directly produced, and the same thing occurs for everyone having the same attitude; there accrue firm possibilities of communicating to others what one has himself seen, of testing descriptions, of making salient the unnoticed intrusions of empty verbal meanings, of making known and weeding out errors by measuring them again against intuition — errors which are also possible herejust as in any sphere of validity. But now to the matters at hand.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§88 . Really Inherent and Intentive Components ^ Mental Processes. The Noema.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Ig as in the present deliberations generally, we begin with the most universal distinctions which, so to speak, can be seized upon at the very threshold of phenomenology, and which are determinative for all further methodic proceedings, then with respect to intentionality &lt;&nbsp;181 &gt;&nbsp;we immediately confront a wholly fundamental distinction, namely the distinction between the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">components proper<sup>2</sup></span><span class="font17"> of intentive mental processes and their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intentional correlates</span><span class="font17"> and their components. We already touched upon this distinction in the preliminary eidetical deliberations of Part IL<sup>3</sup> In that connection, in making the transition from the natural to the phenomenological attitude, the distinction served us to make clear the own peculiar being of the phenomenological sphere. But that it acquired a radical signification within this sphere itself, thus in the frame of the transcendental reduction, conditioning the entire set of problems pertaining to phenomenology: of that we could not speak there. On the one side therefore, we have to discriminate the parts and moments which we find by an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">analysis of the really inherent</span><span class="font17"> pertaining to mental processes, whereby we deal with the mental process as an object like any other, inquiring about its pieces or non-selfsufficient moments really inherent in it which make it up. But, on the other side, the intentive mental process is consciousness of something, and it is so according to its essence, e.g., as memory, as judgment, as will, etc.; and we can therefore inquire into what is to be declared as a matter of essential necessity about the side of this &quot;of something.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Owing to its noetic moments, every intentive mental process is precisely noetic;<sup>4,5</sup> it is of its essence to include in itself something such as a &quot;sense&quot; and possibly a manifold sense on the basis of this sense-bestowal and, in unity with that, to effect further productions </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Leistungen]</span><span class="font17"> which become &quot;sensefiiF' precisely by &lt;this sense-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">bestowab. Such noetic moments are, e.g., directions of the regard of the pure Ego to the objects &quot;meant&quot; by it owing to sense-bestowal, to &lt;the object&gt; which is &quot;inherent in the sense&quot; for the Ego; furthermore, seizing upon this object, holding it fast while the regard adverts to other objects which appear in the “meaning&quot; [&quot; Per</span><span class="font7">加</span><span class="font17">e</span><span class="font7">加</span><span class="font17">e</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">&quot;]; likewise, producings pertaining to explicatings, relatings, comprisings, multiple position-takings of believings, deemings likely, valuings; and so forth. All of these are to be found in the mental processes in question, no matter how difierently structured and varied they are. Now, no matter to what extent this series of exemplary moments refer to really inherent components of mental processes, they nevertheless also refer to what is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not really inherent,</span><span class="font17"> namely by means of the heading of sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Corresponding in every case to the multiplicity ofData pertaining to the really inherent noetic content, there is a multiplicity ofData, demonstrable in actual pure intuition, in a correlative </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;noematic </span><span class="font17">&lt;182&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">content&quot;</span><span class="font17"> or, in short, in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;noema&quot;</span><span class="font17"> — terms which we shall continue to use form now on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Perception, for example, has its noema, most basically its perceptual sense,<sup>6</sup> i.e., the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">perceived as perceived.</span><span class="font17"> Similarly, the current case of remembering has its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">remembered as remembered,</span><span class="font17"> just as its &lt;remembered&gt;, precisely as it is &quot;meant,&quot; &quot;intended to&quot; in &lt;the remembering&gt;; again, the judging has the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">judged as judged,</span><span class="font17"> liking has the liked as liked, and so forth. In every case the noematic correlate, which is called &quot;sense&quot; here (in a very extended signification) is to be taken </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">precisely</span><span class="font17"> as it inheres &quot;immanentally&quot; in the mental process of perceiving, ofjudging, ofliking; and so forth; that is, just as it is offered to us when we </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">inquire purely into this mental process itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">How we understand all of this will become clear by carrying out an exemplary analysis (which we will effect in pure intuition).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us suppose that in a garden we regard with pleasure a blossoming apple tree, the freshly green grass of the lawn, etc. It is obvious that the perception and the accompanying liking are not, at the same time, what is perceived and liked. In the natural attitude, the apple tree is for us something existing in the transcendent realm of spatial actuality, and the perception, as well as the liking, is for us a</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">psychical state belonging to real people. Between the one and the other real things, between the real person or the real perception, and the real apple tree, there exist real relations. In such situations characterizing mental processes, it may be in certain cases that perception is &quot;mere hallucination,&quot; the perceived, this apple tree before us, does not exist in &quot;actual&quot; reality. Now the real relation, previously meant as actually existing, is destroyed. Only the perception remains, but there is nothing actual there to which it is related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us now go to the &lt;transcendental&gt; phenomenological attitude. The transcendent world receives its &quot;parenthesis,&quot; we exercise the </span><span class="font7">玩</span><span class="font17">o%f</span><span class="font11">)</span><span class="font17">in relation to &lt;positing&gt; its actual being. We now ask what, of essential necessity, is to be discovered in the complex of noetic processes pertaining to perception and in the valuation of liking. With the whole physical and psychical world, the actual existence of &lt;183&gt; the real relation between perceiving and perceived is excluded;<sup>7</sup> and, nonetheless, a relation between perceiving and perceived (as well as between liking and liked) remains left over, a relation which becomes given essentially in &quot;pure immanence,&quot; namely purely on the ground of the phenemenologically reduced mental processes of perceiving and liking precisely as they fit into the transcendental stream of mental processes. Precisely this situation, the purely phenomenological one, will occupy us now. Concerning hallucinations, illusions and perceptual deception of whatever sort, it may be that phenomenology has something to say, and perhaps even a great deal: but it is evident that here, in the role which they played in the natural attitude, they undergo exclusion.<sup>8</sup> Here, in the case of perception and also in the case of any progressive concatentation of perceptions whatever (as when we consider the blossoming tree ambulando), there is no question to be raised of the sort whether or not something corresponds to it in &quot;the&quot; actuality.<sup>9</sup> This posited actuality<sup>10</sup> is indeed not there for us in consequence of judging.<sup>11</sup> And yet, so to</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">speak, everything remains as of old. Even the phenomenologically reduced perceptual mental process is a perceiving d&quot;this blossoming apple tree, in this garden J etc., and, likewise, the reduced liking is a liking of this same thing. The tree has not lost the least nuance of all these moments, qualities, characteristics </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">with which it was appearing in this perception,</span><span class="font17"> &lt;with which&gt; it &lt;was appearing as&gt;</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>i(</sup>lovely,&quot;<sup>i(</sup>attractive^ </span><span class="font17">and so forth <sup>&lt;t</sup>in^^ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">this liking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In our &lt;transcendental&gt; phenomenological attitude we can and must raise the eidetic question: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">what the ^perceived as perceived&quot;&quot; is, which eidetic moments it includes in itself as this perception-noema.</span><span class="font17"> We receive the answer in the pure directedness to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">something given</span><span class="font17"> in its essence, and we can faithfully describe the ''appearing as appearing&quot; in complete evidence. It is only another expression for this to say that we &quot;describe perception in its noematic respect.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§89 . Noematic Statements and Statements About Actuality. The Noema in the Psychological Sphere.<sup>12,</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">It is clear that all these descriptive statements, even though they may sound like statements about actuality, have undergone a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">radical </span><span class="font17">modification of sense; similarly, the described itself, even though it is </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">184</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">given as ''precisely the same J is yet something radically different by virtue of, so to speak, an inverse change of signs. <sup>&lt;t</sup>In^^ the reduced perception (in the phenomenologically pure mental process), we find, as indefeasibly belonging to its essence, the perceived as perceived, to be expressed as &quot;material thing J &quot;plant J &quot;tree J &quot;blossom-ing;^<sup>,</sup> and so forth. Obviously, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">inverted commas</span><span class="font17"> are significant in that they express that change in sign, the correspondingly radical significational modification of the words. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">tree simpliciter,</span><span class="font17"> the physical thing belonging to Nature, is nothing less than this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">perceived tree as perceived</span><span class="font17"> which, as perceptual sense, inseparably belongs to the<sup>13</sup> perception. The tree simpliciter can burn up, be resolved into its chemical elements, etc. But the sense — the sense </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of this</span><span class="font17"> perception, something belonging necessarily to its essence — cannot burn up; it has no chemical elements, no forces, no real properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Everything which is purely immanent and reduced in the way</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">peculiar to the mental process, everything which cannot be conceived apart from it just as it is in itself, and which eo ipso passes over into the Eidos in the eidetic attitude, is separated by an abyss from all of Nature and physics and no less from all psychology — and even this image, as naturalistic, is not strong enough to indicate the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Obviously the perceptual sense also belongs to the phenomenologically unreduced perception (perception in the sense of psychology). Thus one can make clear here at the same time how the phenomenological reduction can acquire for psychologists the useful methodic function offixing the noematic sense by sharply distinguishing it from the object simpliciter, and recognizing it as something belonging inseparably to the<sup>14</sup> psychological essence of the intentive mental process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On both sides, in the psychological as well as in the phenomenological attitude, one must therefore not lose sight of the feet that the &quot;perceived'' as sense includes nothing in itself (thus nothing should be imputed to it on the ground of''indirect cognizances&quot;) other than what &quot;actually appears&quot; in the given case in something perceptually appearing and, more precisely, in the mode of givenness in which it is precisely something intended to in the perception. At any time a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">specifically peculiar reflection</span><span class="font17"> can be directed to this sense as it is immanent in the perception, and the phenomenological judgment has to conform in faithful expression to what is seized upon in it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Like perception, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font17"> intentive mental process —just this makes up the fundamental part of intentionality — has its &quot;intentional Ob-ject,<sup>M</sup> i.e., its objective sense. Or, in other words: to have sense or &quot;to intend to&quot; somethihg </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[etwas</span><span class="font7"> ‘&gt;加 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Sinne</span><span class="font7"> 之〃 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">haben'],</span><span class="font17"> is the fundamental characteristic of all consciousness which, therefore, is not just any mental living </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Erlebnis]</span><span class="font17"> whatever, but is rather a &lt;mental living&gt; having sense, which is ''noetic.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Certainly what has become prominent as ''sense'' in the analysis of our examples does not exhaust the full noema; correspondingly, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">218 </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO PURE PHENOMENOLOGY </span><span class="font17">noetic side of the intentive mental process does not merely consist of the moment of &quot;sense-bestowal&quot; proper specifically belonging to the &quot;sense&quot; as correlate. It will be shown directly that the full noema consists of a complex of noematic moments, that in &lt;that complex&gt; the specific sense-moment only fashions one kind of necessary </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">core-stratum </span><span class="font17">in which further moments are essentially founded which, therefore, should likewise be designated as sense-moments, but in an extended meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Nevertheless, let us remain at first with what alone has clearly emerged. Without doubt we have shown that the intentive mental process is of such a character that in a suitable focusing of regard a &quot;sense&quot; is to be drawn from it. The situation defining the sense for us cannot remain concealed: the circumstance, namely, that the nonexistence (or the<sup>15</sup> conviction of non-existence) of the objectivated or thought of Object pure and simple pertaining to the ohjectivation in question (and therefore to any particular intentive mental process whatever) cannot steal its something objectivated as objectivated,<sup>16 </sup>that therefore the distinction between both must be made. Such a striking distinction has required expression in the literature. As a matter of fact, the Scholastic distinction between the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>((</sup>mental^ ^intentional^</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>Qi</sup>immanental^</span><span class="font17"> Object on the one hand, and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;actual&quot; Object</span><span class="font17"> on the other hand, refers back to it. Nevertheless, it is an immense step tQ go from seizing upon a distinction pertaining to consciousness for the first time to its right, phenomenologically pure, fixing and correct valuation -— and precisely this step, which is decisive for a harmonious, fruitful phenomenology, has not been effected. Above all, what is decisive consists of the absolutely faithful description of what is actually present in phenomenological purity and in keeping at a distance all the interpretations transcending the given. Here denominations already evince interpretations, and often quite false ones. These interpretations betray themselves here in </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">186</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">expressions such as &quot;mental,&quot; &quot;immanental&quot; Object, and the expression &quot;intentional Object&quot; requires them the least of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It would even be tempting to say: In the mental process the intention is given with its intentional Object which, as intentional Object, inseparably belongs to it, therefore itself </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">inherently</span><span class="font17"> dwells within &lt;the intention&gt;. Indeed, it is and remains its &lt;Ohject&gt; meant,</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">objectivated, and the like, no matter if the corresponding &quot;&nbsp;actual Object<sup>,&gt;</sup> precisely is or is not in actuality, ifit has been annihilated in the meantime, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But if, in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font17"> way, we try to separate the actual Object (in the case of perception of something external, the perceived physical thing pertaining to Nature) and the intentional Object, including the latter &lt;as&gt; really inherently in the mental process as &quot;immanent&quot; to the perception, we fall into the difficulty that now </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font17"> realities ought to stand over against one another while only </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> &lt;reality&gt; is found to be present and even possible. I perceive the physical thing, the Object belonging to Nature, the tree there in the garden; that and nothing else is the actual Object of the perceptual &quot;intention.&quot; A second immanental tree, or even an &quot;internal image&quot; of the actual tree standing out there before me, is in no way given, and to suppose that hypothetically leads to an absurdity. The image as a really inherent component in the psychologically real perception would be again something real — something real which would </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">function</span><span class="font17"> as a depicturing of another something real. But that can only be by virtue of a depicturing consciousness in which something first appears — with which we would have a first intentionality — and this would function again in consciousness as a &quot;picture Object&quot; representing another &quot;picture Object&quot; — for which a second intentionality founded in the first intentionality would be necessary. It is no less evident that each particular one of these modes of consciousness already requires the distinction between the immanental and actual object, thus comprising the same problem which should have been resolved by the construction. Over and above this, in the case of perception, the construction is subject to the objection which we have discussed earlier:<sup>17</sup> to include depictive functions in the perception of something physical signifies ascribing to it a picture-consciousness which, descriptively considered, is something of an essentially different kind of constitution. Nevertheless, the main point here is that perception and, then consequently, every mental process, requires a depictive function, unavoidably (as can be seen at once from our critique) leads to an infinite regress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In contradistinction to such errors we have to abide by what is</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">187</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">given in the pure mental process and to take it within the frame of clarity precisely as it is given. I he “actual&quot; Object is then to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">author's footnote:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cf above, §43, pp. 78f.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;parenthesized.&quot; Let us reflect on what that signifies: if we begin as people in the natural attitude, then the actual Object is the physical thing there, outside &lt;us&gt;. We see it, we stand before it, we have directed our eyes fixingly to it, and then we describe it and make our statements about it just as we find it there in space as what confronts us. Likewise we take a position toward it in valuing; what confronts us, what we see in space, pleases us, or determines us to act; we seize upon or manipulate what is given there, etc. If we now effect the phenomenological reduction, then every positing of something transcendent, thus above all what is inherent to perception itself, receives its excluding parentheses, and this is passed on to all of the founded acts, to every judgment of perception, to the positing of value, and possibly to the value judgment grounded in it. Implicit in this is that we only allow all these perceivings, judgings, etc., to be considered, to be described, as the essentialities which they are in themselves, to pin down what is evidently given with or in them. But we do not tolerate any judgment which makes use of the positing of the &quot;actual&quot; physical thing, nor of the whole &quot;transcendent&quot; Nature, or which &quot;joins in&quot; &lt;that positing&gt;. As </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenologists</span><span class="font17"> we abstain from all such positings. But on that account we do not reject them by not &quot;taking them as our basis,<sup>55</sup> by not<sup>4</sup> joining in<sup>55</sup> them. They are indeed there, they also essentially belong to the phenomenon. Rather we contemplate them; instead of joining in them, we make them Objects, take them as component parts of the phenomenon — the positing pertaining to perception as well as its components.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And, keeping these excludings in their clear sense, we therefore ask quite universally, then, about what is evidentially &quot;inherent&quot; in the whole &quot;reduced&quot; phenomenon. Now, inherent too precisely in perception is this: that it has its noematic sense, its &quot;perceived as perceived,<sup>55</sup> &quot;this blossoming tree there, in space<sup>55</sup> — understood with inverted commas — precisely the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">correlate</span><span class="font17"> belonging to the essence of phenomenologically reduced perception. Figuratively stated: the &quot;parenthesis” undergone by perception prevents any judgment about perceived actuality (i.e., any &lt;judgment&gt; having its basis in unmodified perception, thus taking up into itselfits positing). But it does not prevent thejudgment about the fact that perception is </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">188</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">consciousness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">qf</span><span class="font17">an actuality (the positing of which, however, should not be &quot;effected&quot;); and it does not prevent any description of this perceptually appearing '&quot;actuality<sup>55</sup> as appearing with the particular ways in which it is here intended to, appearing only &quot;one-sidedly,&quot; in</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">this or that orientation; and so forth. With minute care we must now take heed against attributing to the mental process anything which is not actually included in its essence, and &lt;we must&gt; &quot;attribute&quot; &lt;what is included&gt; exactly and just as it precisely is &quot;inherent&quot; in it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">What was carried out in detail primarily in the case of perception actually holds now for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all kinds of intentive mental processes.</span><span class="font17"> After the reduction we find the remembered as remembered in remembering, the expected as expected in expecting, the phantasied as phantasied in inventive phantasy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;Inhering&quot; in each of these mental processes in a noematic sense,<sup>18</sup> and however this &lt;noematic senso may be akin in diflerent mental processes, indeed perchance essentially quite alike with res-pcct to a core-component, in any case the &lt;noematic sense&gt; is different in kind in various sorts of mental processes; what is common in a given case is at least differently characterized and is so of necessity. In every case it may be a matter of the blossoming tree, and in every case this tree may appear in a certain way such that the faithful description of what appears as it appears necessarily results in the same expression. But for that reason the noematic correlates are still essentially diflerent for perception, phantasy, presentiating something depicted, remembering, etc. At one time what appears is characterized as &quot;'actuality in person,&quot; at another time as fiction, then again as something presentiated in a remembering, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">These are characteristics which we </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">find present in</span><span class="font17"> the perceived, phantasied, remembered, and so forth, as perceived, phantasied, remembered — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the sense of the perception, in the sense ofphantasy, in the sense /memory</span><span class="font17"> — as something inseparable and as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">something necessarily belonging in correlation to the respective kinds of noetic processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Where it is a matter of describing the intentional correlates faithfully and completely, there we must also apprehend all such characteristics which are never accidental but are instead governed by eidetic law and fixed into rigorous concepts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this connection, we note what within the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">full</span><span class="font17"> noema (in fact, as</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">189</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">we have previously indicated) we must separate </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essentially different</span></p>

When, again, we set aside the parentheses effected on the positing, we see that, in a parallel way, corresponding to the different concepts of sense we must distinguish different concepts of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unmodified objectivities,</span><span class="font17"> of which the &quot;object simpliciter,&quot; namely the something identical which is perceived at one time, another time directly presentiated, a third time presented pictorially in a painting, and the like, only indicates </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> central concept.

<p><span class="font17">§92 . </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Noetic and Noematic Aspects of Attentional Changes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">In our preparatory chapters we spoke repeatedly of a species of remarkable changes in consciousness which cut across all other species of intentional events and thus make up a quite universal structure of consciousness having its own peculiar dimension: We spoke metaphorically of the pure Ego's &quot;mental regard&quot; or the &quot;ray of its regard,&quot; of its advertings toward and turning away from. The relevant phenomena stood out unitarily for us with perfect clarity and distinctness. Wherever &quot;attention&quot; is spoken of originarily, they play a major role without being separated phenomenologically from certain other phenomena; and, mixed with these others, they are usually designated as modes of attention. For our part, we mean to retain the word and, moreover, to speak </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">o{attentional changes,</span><span class="font17"> but with exclusive reference to the events </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font17"> have separated distinctly and the groups of phenomenal changes still to be described more precisely in what follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">^ Mai^ina! note</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> i</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">〃</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Copy /) to</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> central core andobjeclivc sense: Lateron core and sense </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a.vc separated! </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Pp. 273f.; bcfbrc pp. 197f., 247f.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">In this context it is a question of a series ofideally possible changes &lt;&nbsp;190&gt; which already presuppose a noetic core and the characterizing moments of various genera which necessarily belong to it; of themselves, &lt;these possible changes&gt; do not alter the correlative noematic productions but, nevertheless, exhibit alterations of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">whole</span><span class="font17"> mental process with respect to both its noetic and noematic sides. The ray of the pure Ego's regard sometimes goes through one noetic stratum and sometimes through another, or (as, e.g., in the case of rememberings within rememberings<sup>21</sup>) through one encasement-level or another, sometimes straightforwardly, sometimes reflectively. Within the given total field of potential noeses and correlative objects of noeses we sometimes look at a whole, the tree, perhaps, which is perceptually present, sometimes at these or those parts and moments of it; then, again, we look at a nearby physical thing or at a complex context and process. Suddenly we turn our regard to an object of memory which &quot;comes to mind:” Instead of going through the perceptual noesis, which, in a continuously unitary though highly articulated manner, constitutes for us the continually appearing world of physical things, the regard goes through a remembering noesis into a world of memory; it wanders about in this world, passes over into memories of other degrees or into worlds of<sup>22</sup> phantasy, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For the sake of simplicity, let us remain in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> intentive stratum in the world of perception which stands there in simple certainty. Let us take a physical thing or a physical process of which there is a perceptual consciousness, and fix it, in idea, with respect to its noematic contents, while we take the whole concrete consciousness of physical thing or the physical process throughout the corresponding section of phenomenological duration, and fix </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font17"> with respect to its full immanental essence. For the idea in question involves fixing of the attentional ray as wandering in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">determinate</span><span class="font17"> manner &lt;throughout that section of phenomenological duration,</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">since &lt;the attentional ray&gt; too is a moment of the mental process. It is then evident that modes of alteration of the fixed mental process are possible<sup>23</sup> which we designate by the name, &quot;alterations merely in the distribution of attention and its modes.” It is clear that, throughout such alterat-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ions, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic</span><span class="font17"> composition of the mental process remains the same in so far as one can always say that the same objectivity is continuously characterized as being there in person, presenting itself in the same modes of appearance, in the same orientations, with the same appearing traits; that in the modes of indeterminate indication, of making non-intuitively copresent, and so forth, there is a consciousness of such and such a stock of content belonging to it. Selecting out &lt;&nbsp;191 &gt;&nbsp;and comparing parallel noematic components, we say that the alteration consists </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">merely</span><span class="font17"> of the fact that, in one of the compared cases, one moment of the object is <sup>4</sup>'favored<sup>,J</sup> and, in another case, another; or of the fact that one and the same moment is &quot;paid attention to primarily” at one time and only secondarily at another time, or 'just barely noticed still,&quot; if not indeed ''completely unnoticed^^ though still appearing. Those are indeed different modes belonging specifically to attention as such. Among them the group of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actionality modes</span><span class="font17"> are separated from the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">non-actionality mode,</span><span class="font17"> from what we call complete inattention, the mode which is, so to speak, dead consciousness of something.<sup>24</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the other hand, it is clear not only that these are modifications of the mental process itself with respect to its noetic composition, but also that they affect its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noema,</span><span class="font17"> that, on the noematic side ——without touching the identical noematic core — they present a separate genus of characterizations. Attention is usually compared to a spot light. The object of attention, in the specific sense, lies in the cone of more or less bright light; but it can also move into the penumbra and into the completely dark region. Though the metaphor is far from adequate to differentiate all the modes which can be fixed phenomenologically, it is still designative in so far as it indicates alterations in what appears, as what appears. These changes in its illumination do not alter what appears with respect to its own </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sense</span><span class="font17"> -composition; but brightness and obscurity modify its mode of appearance: they are to be found and described when we direct out regard to the noematic Object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Obviously the modifications in the noema are not of such a kind that<sup>25</sup> mere outward adjuncts are added to something which remains unvaryingly identical; on the contrary, the concrete noemas</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">change through and through, it being a question of necessary modes belonging to the mode in which the identical is given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Yet, on closer inspection, it is not the case that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">entire</span><span class="font17"> noematic content (the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">attentional core,</span><span class="font17"> so to speak) characterized by this or that mode can be kept constant in contrast to any attentional modifications whatever.<sup>26</sup> On the contrary, looked at from the noetic side it becomes apparent that certain noeses, either necessarily or with respect to their determined possibility, are conditioned by modes of attention and in particular, by positive attention in the distinctive sense &lt;of this word&gt;. All ^effecting of acts J the &quot;actional takings of positions,<sup>,?</sup> e.g., <sup>^^</sup>eflfecting^^ the settlement of a doubt, the &quot;making&quot; </span><span class="font7">「' </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Vollzug&quot;}</span><span class="font17"> of a refusal, the &quot;effecting'' of a<sup>27</sup> subject-positing and a predicative positing-thereupon, the making [ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Vollzug\</span><span class="font17"> of a valuation or of a valuation for the sake of something else, the making of a choice, and so forth — all these presuppose positive attention to that toward which the Ego takes aposition.<sup>28</sup> But this in no way alters the fact that this functioning of the regard, which moves about and broadens or narrows its span, signifies a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">dimension sui generis of correlative. noetic and noematic,</span><span class="font17"> modifications, the systematic inquiry into the essence of which is among the fundamental tasks of general phenomenology.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">It is in their actionality-modes that attentional formations have, in a pre-eminent manner, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">characteristic of subjectiveness^</span><span class="font17"> and this characteristic is consequently acquired by all the<sup>30</sup> functionings which become modalized by these modes or which, according to their specific sort, presuppose them. The ray of attention presents itself as emanating from the pure Ego and terminating in that which is objective, as directed to it or being diverted from it. The ray does not become detached from the Ego; on the contrary, it is itself an Ego-ray, and remains an Ego-ray. The &quot;Object&quot; is struck; it is the target, it is put into a relation to the Ego (and by the Ego itself) but is not &quot;subjective.&quot; A position-taking which bears the Ego-ray is, because ofit, an act of the Ego itself; the Ego does or undergoes, is free or conditioned.

But the expression, <sup>4t</sup>as a free being,<sup>9,</sup> indicates nothing else than such modes of living pertaining to freely going out of itself or freely withdrawing into itself spontaneous doing, being somehow affected by the Objects, suffering, etc. What goes on in the stream of mental processes outside the Ego-ray or the cogito is essentially characterized otherwise; it lies outside the Ego's actionality and yet, as we indicated earlier, it is appertinent to the Ego in so far as it is the field of potentiality for the Ego's free acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So much by way of a general characterization of the noetic-noema-tic themes which must be treated with systematic thoroughness in the phenomenology of attention.<sup>32</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">193</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§93. Transition to the Noetic-Noematic Structures of the Higher Spheres of Consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the next series of considerations we wish to examine the structures which belong to the &quot;higher&quot; spheres of consciousness in which </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">number of noeses are built up on one another in the unity of a concrete mental process</span><span class="font17"> and in which, accordingly, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic correlates</span><span class="font17"> are likewise </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">founded.</span><span class="font17"> Thus the eidetic law, confirmed in every case, states that there can be </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">no noetic moment without a noematic moment specifically belonging to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Even in the case of noeses of a higher level<sup>33</sup> — taken in concrete completeness — there at first emerges in the noematic composition a central core thrusting itself to the fore in a predominate way, the &quot;meant Objectivity as Objectivity,<sup>5,</sup> the Objectivity in inverted commas as required by the phenomenological reduction. There this central noema must also be taken precisely in the modified Objective composition in which it is just that noema, something intended to as intended to. Because the Objective something taken in a modified way itself becomes, to be sure, under the heading of sense, as, e.g., in our scientific investigation of it, again an Objective something although of a dignity peculiar to it, one will subsequently see here that this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">novel Objectivity</span><span class="font17"> has its modes of givenness, its &quot;characteristics,<sup>5,</sup> its manifold modes with which it is intended to in the full noema pertaining to the noetic mental process or to the species of mental process in question. Of course, here again all the distinctions in the noema must also correspond to parallel distinctions in the unmodified Objectivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is then a further undertaking of more precise phenomenological study to discover what is prescribed according to eidetic law precisely by the species, and what is so prescribed by the differentiating particularities, for noemata of changing particularities of a fixed </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">194</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">species (eg, perception). But the restriction holds throughout: in the sphere of essences there is nothing accidental; everything is connected by eidetic relations, thus especially noesis and noema.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§94. Noesis and Noema in the Realm of Judgment.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">As an example from this sphere offbunded essences let us consider the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">predicative judgment.</span><span class="font17"> The noema of the judging, i.e., of the concrete judgmental process, is the &quot;judged as judged;'' that, however, is nothing else, or at least with respect to its main core, it is nothing else than what we usually call simply </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If the full noema is to be seized upon, thejudgment must be taken here in the full noematic concreteness intended to in the concrete judging. What is judged must not be confused with what is judged about. If the judging is based on perceiving or on some other simply “positing&quot; objectivating, the noema of the objectivatinggoes into the</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">full concretion of the judgment<sup>34</sup> (just as the objectivating noesis becomes an essential component of the concrete judgmental noesis) and takes on certain forms in thejudging. That which is objectivated (as objectivated) receives the form of the apophantic subject, or that of the apophantic predicate, or some other such form. Here, for the sake of simplicity, let us disregard the higher stratum pertaining to verbal &quot;expression.” These &quot;objects about which,&quot; especially the ones which take on &lt;apophantic&gt; subject &lt;-fbrms&gt; [ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Su bjektgegens land] </span><span class="font17">are the objects judged </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">about.</span><span class="font17"> The whole which is formed out of them, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the total What which is judged</span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">and, moreover, taken precisely in the fashion (with the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">characterization,</span><span class="font17"> in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mode of givenness)</span><span class="font17"> in which it is &quot;intended to” in the mental process ——makes up the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">full noematic correlate,</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>(i</sup>sense&quot;&quot;</span><span class="font17"> (in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">broadest</span><span class="font17"> signification of the word) of the judgmental process. Stated more pregnantly, it is the &quot;sense in the How of its mode ofgivenness<sup>,5</sup> in so far as this mode of givenness is to be found as a characteristic belonging to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this connection, we must not overlook the phenomenological reduction which requires us to &quot;parenthesize” the making of the judgment if we wish to acquire the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure</span><span class="font17"> noema of our judgmental process. If we do so, then we have in its phenomenological purity the full concrete essence of the judgmental process or, as we now express it, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">judgment-noesis, taken concretely as an essence,</span><span class="font17"> and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">judgment-noema</span><span class="font17"> belonging to and necessarily united with that noesis, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;made judgment as an Eidos,</span><span class="font17"> and it also in its phenomenological purity.</span></p>

For us this distinction has already been thoroughly established. But the reader who accepts it will also be perplexed. For he is required to recognize that this one distinction is by no means sufficient and that it is necessary to fix a number of ideas which lie on two different sides within the essence ofjudgmental intentionality. It must above all be recognized that here, as in the case of any other intentive mental process, the two sides, noesis and noema, must by essential necessity be distinguished.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font17">The latter, then, should be understood as the &quot;judgment&quot; or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">proposition in the sense of the word in pure logic</span><span class="font17"> — except that pure logic is interested in the noema, not with respect to its components, but only in so far as it is conceived as exclusively determined by a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">narrower </span><span class="font17">essence, to the more precise definition of which the above-mentioned attempt at a distinction in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen</span><span class="font17"> pointed the way. If we wish to obtain the full noema of a determinate judgmental process we must, as has already been said, take &quot;the&quot; judgment precisely as it is intended to in just that process; whereas, for formal logic, the identity of &quot;the” judgment extends much further. An evident judgment, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">S is p,</span><span class="font17"> and &quot;the same&quot; judgment as a &quot;blind&quot; judgment are noematically different but identical with respect to a core of sense which alone is decisive from the standpoint of formal logic. The difference here is similar to that already mentioned &lt;&nbsp;196&gt; between the noema of a perception and that of a parallel pre-sentiation which intends to thesame object, with precisely the same set of determinations and with the same characterization (as &quot;certainly existing,&quot; &quot;doubtfully existing,&quot; or the like). The act-species are different, and there is wide room for phenomenological differences in other respects — but the<sup>37</sup> noematic What is identical. Let us add that the idea of the judgment which has just been characterized and which functions as the fundamental concept in formal logic (that discipline within mathesis universalis pertaining to predicative significations) has as its correlate the noetic idea: &quot;the judgment&quot; in a second sense understood, namely, as any judging whatever, with an</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">eidetic universality determined purely by the form. It is the fundamental concept in the formal noetic theory of correct judging.<sup>38</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Everythingjust said is also true for other noetic mental processes; for example, it obviously holds good for all those which are essentially akin to judgings as predicative certainties: for the corresponding deemings possible, deemings likely, doubting, also rejectings. Among these the agreement can go so far that, in the noema, a sense-content occurs which is identical throughout and is merely furnished with &lt;197&gt; different <sup>t&lt;</sup>characte^izations.^^ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The same</span><span class="font17"> <sup>1&lt;</sup>S is p,<sup>M</sup> as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic core,</span><span class="font17"> can be the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="font17"> of a certainty, a deeming possible, a deeming likely, etc. In the noema the</span><span class="font7">、'</span><span class="font17">S is p” does not stand alone; rather, as singled out of the noema by thinking, it is something non-selfsufficient; it is intended to with changing characterizations indispensable to the full noema: it is intended to with the characteristic of something <sup>14</sup>certain,<sup>5, t&lt;</sup>possible,^^ <sup>t&lt;</sup>probable,^^ “null J or the like — characteristics, to which the modifying inverted commas collectively belong and which, as correlates, are specifically coordinated with the noetic moments of considering-possible, considering-probable, consider-ing-null, and the like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With this, as we see at the same time, two fundamental concepts of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'''judgment-content<sup>?</sup> </span><span class="font17">and likewise of likelihood-content, questioncontent, etc., are separated from one another.

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§95 . The Analogous Distinctions in the Emotional and Volitional Spheres.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Analogous statements hold, then, as one can easily see, for the emotional and volitional spheres, for mental processes of liking or disliking, of valuing in any sense, of wishing, deciding, acting. All these are mental processes which contain many and often heterogeneous intentive strata, the noetic and, correspondingly, also the noematic ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In that connection, the stratifications, generally speaking, are such that the uppermost strata of the total phenomenon can be removed without the remainder ceasing to be a concretely complete intentive mental process,<sup>39</sup> and, conversely, a concrete mental process can also take on a new noetic total stratum: as when a non-selfsufficient moment of &quot;valuing” is stratified on a concrete process of simply objectivating or, on the other hand, is removed again.<sup>40</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If, in this manner, a perceiving, phantasying, judging, or the like,</span><span class="font7">〈 </span><span class="font17">198</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">founds a stratum of valuing which overlays it completely, we have </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">different noemata or senses</span><span class="font17"> in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">stratified whole</span><span class="font17"> which is called a concrete mental process of valuing by being designated according to the highest level within it. The perceived as perceived specifically belongs as sense to the perceiving, but it is also included in the sense of the concrete valuing, founding the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">latters's</span><span class="font17"> sense. We must distinguish accordingly: the objects, the physical things, the qualities, the predicatively formed affair-complexes, which are present as valued in</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">the valuing, or else the corresponding noemata of the objectivatirigs, thejudgings, or the like, which found the value-consciousness; on the other hand, the value-objects themselves and the predicatively formed value-complexes themselves, or else the noematic modifications corresponding to them; and then, universally, the complete noemata belonging to the concrete value-consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">By way of explanation let us say first of all that, for the sake of greater distinctness, we do well (here and in all analogous cases) to introduce distinctive relative terms in order to keep sharply separate valuable object and value-object, valuable predicatively formed aflair-complex and predicatively formed value-complexes, valuable property and value-property ( a term having itself two senses).-We shall speak of the mere &quot;thing&quot; which is valuable, which has a valuecharacteristic, which has </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">value-quality;</span><span class="font17"> in contradistinction, we speak </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">o{ concrete value</span><span class="font17"> itself or the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">value- Objectiveness [ WertobjektitdtJ.</span><span class="font17"> Likewise we shall speak of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mere predicatively formed affair-complex</span><span class="font17"> or the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mere lay</span><span class="font7"> 炉 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">things / Sachlage]</span><span class="font17"> and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">predicatively formed value-complex</span><span class="font17"> or the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">lay of values</span><span class="font17"> f </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Wertlage/,</span><span class="font17"> namely where the valuing has a consciousness of a predicatively formed affair-complex as its founding substratum. The value-Objectiveness involves its mere materially determinate thing / </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Sac he</span><span class="font17"> /; it introduces, as a new Objective stratum, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">valuequality.</span><span class="font17"> The predicatively formed value-complex contains the mere predicatively formed affair-complex belonging to it; in like manner the value-property contains the materially determinate thingproperty and, in addition the value-quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Here too one must distinguish between the value-Objectiveness simpliciter and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">value-Objectiveness in inverted commas</span><span class="font17"> which is included in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noema.</span><span class="font17"> Just as the perceived as perceived stands over against the perceiving in a way excluding the question of whether the perceived truly exists, so the valued as valued stands over against the valuing, and likewise in a way excluding the question of the being of the value (the being of the valued thing </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font17"> the latter's being truly a value). One must exclude all actional positings in order to seize upon the noema. Moreover, careful attention must be paid to the fact that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">full</span><span class="font17"> &quot;sense&quot; of the valuing includes its What in which it is </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">199</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">intended to in the mental process of valuing in question, and that the value-Objectiveness in inverted commas is not, by itself, the full noema.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In like manner the distinctions made here can be made in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">volitional sphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On one side we have the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">deciding</span><span class="font17"> which we effect together with the mental processes which it demands as a substratum, and which, when it is taken in its concreteness, it includes. To it belong many different noetic moments. Volitional positings are based on valuing positings, physical-thing positings, and the like. On the other side we find the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">decision</span><span class="font17"> as a peculiar kind of Objectiveness specifically belonging to the province of volition; and it is an Objectiveness obviously founded on other such noematic Objectivenesses. Ig as pheno-menologists, we exclude all our positings, the volitional phenomenon, as a phenomenologically pure intentive mental process, still retains its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^willed as willed^</span><span class="font17"> as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noema belonging peculiarly to the willing: the ^volition-meaning^</span><span class="font17"> precisely as it is a &quot;meaning” in this willing (in the full essence &lt;of the willing&gt;) and with everything being willed and &quot;aimed at.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We said, &quot;the meaning.<sup>55</sup> This word suggests itself in all these contexts, just as do the words &quot;sense” and &quot;signification.'' To the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">meaning [Meinen]</span><span class="font17"> or intending to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Vermeinen],</span><span class="font17"> then, corresponds the meant </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Meinung]; </span><span class="font17">to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">signifying,</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">signification.</span><span class="font17"> But the greatest precaution is called for with respect to these words because they all have been infected with so many equivocations by transference, not least of all by equivocations which arise from slipping from one to another of the correlative strata which we are trying to separate with scientific rigor. The scope of our present observations is the broadest extension of the essential genus, &quot;intentive mental process.<sup>55 </sup>&quot;Meaning,” on the other hand, is normally spoken of in referring to narrower spheres which,, however, function as substrata for other phenomena in the wider sphere. As technical terms, therefore, this word and cognate expressions should be used only with reference to those narrower spheres. In referring to the universalities involved, we are undoubtedly better served by our new terms and the attached analyses of examples.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§96 . Transition to Further Chapters. Concluding Remarks.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">We have bestowed such great care on working out universally the difference between noesis (i.e., the concretely complete intentive mental process, designated by a name emphasizing its noetic components) and noema because the seizing upon and mastering it are of &lt;200&gt; the greatest importance for phenomenology, are indeed decisive for</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">the legitimate grounding of phenomenology. At first glance it would seem to be something obvious: Any consciousness is a consciousness of something, and the modes of consciousness are highly diversified. On approaching more closely, however, we became sensible of the great difficulties involved. They concern our understanding of the mode of being of the noema, the way in which it is &quot;implicit” in the mental process, in which it is &quot;intended to” in the mental process. Quite particularly they concern the clean separation of those things which, as its really inherent components, belong to the mental process itself and those which belong to the noema, which must be assigned to the noema as its own &lt;components&gt;. Subsequently the correct analysis of the parallel structures of noesis and noema involves considerable difficulties. Even when we have succeeded in making some of the major relevant distinctions in examining the ohjectivatings and judgings, where they are first presented and for which logic has done valuable though far from adequate preliminary work, some effort and self-control is needed in order to actually make the parallel distinctions clearly given in the case of emotional acts, instead of only postulating and asserting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Here, in the context of our merely introductory meditations, we cannot undertake to develop parts of phenomenology systematically. Nevertheless, our aims require that we go into things more deeply than we have up to now and project the , beginnings of such investigations. That is necessary in order to make noetic-noematic structures clear enough so that their significance for the problems and methods of phenomenology may become understandable. A detailed idea of the fruitfulness of phenomenology, the magnitude of its problems and the nature of its procedure is only achieved by actually entering province after province and seeing the extent of the relevant problems. But any such province is actually entered and becomes sensible as a field for solid work only when one makes the phenomenological distinctions and clarifications by which alone the sense of the problems to be solved in it can become understandable. Our further analyses and exhibitions of problems will be strictly confined to this style, as our previous efforts have been in part. However complicated the matters treated may seem to the novice, still we shall consider only restricted spheres. Naturally we shall &lt;201&gt; give preference to what is relatively close to the gates of phenomenology and to what is unconditionally necessary in order to trace main systematic lines extending throughout the realm. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">All of it</span><span class="font17"> is hard</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><sub>a</sub>nd requires laborious concentration on the data of specifically phenomenological eidetic intuition. There is no &quot;royal road&quot; into phenomenology and therefore none into philosophy. There is only the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> road prescribed by phenomenology's own essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Finally, the following remark would seem to be in order. Phenomenology is presented in our exposition as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">beginning</span><span class="font17"> science. How many of the results of the analyses undertaken here are definitive, only the future can tell. Certainly much of what we have described will have to be described otherwise sub specie aeterni. But one thing we may and must strive for: that at each step we faithfully describe what we, from our point of view and after the most serious study, actually see. Our procedure is that of an explorer journeying through an unknown part of the world, and carefully describing what is presented along his unbeaten paths, which will not always be the shortest. Such an explorer can rightfully be filled with the sure confidence that he gives utterance to what, at the time and under the circumstances, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font17"> be said — something which, because it is the faithful expression of something seen, will always retain its value — even though new explorations will require new descriptions with manifold improvements. With a like conviction, in the sequel we propose to be faithful describers of phenomenological structures and, moreover, to preserve the habit ofinner freedom even with respect to our own descriptions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">THE SET OF PROBLEMS PERTAINING TO NOETIC-NOEMATIC STRUCTURES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§97 . The Hyletic and Noetic Moments as Really Inherent Moments, the Noematic Moments as Really Non-inherent Moments, of Mental Processes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">When introducing the distinction between the noetic and the noematic in the last chapter, we used the expressions, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">analysis of the really inherent</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intentional analysis.</span><span class="font17"> Let us start with that. A phenomenologically pure mental process has its really inherent components. For the sake of simplicity, let us restrict ourselves to noetic mental processes of the lowest level, namely<sup>1</sup> to those which are not complicated in their intentionality by a variety of noetic strata built one upon another such as we found to be the case in acts of thinking and in emotional and volitional acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A sensuous perception may possibly Serve as an example: the tree-perception simpliciter which we have while lookingout into the </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">202</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">garden when, in a unity of consciousness, we are looking at that tree over there which is now motionless and then appears blown by the wind, and which is also presented in greatly differing modes of appearance as we, during our continuing observation, change our spatial position relative to the tree — perhaps we go to the window or simply alter the position of our head or eyes, while perhaps at the same time relaxing and concentrating our &lt;visual&gt; accomodation, etc. In this way the unity of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> perception can include a great multiplicity of modifications which we, as observers in the natural attitude, sometimes ascribe to the actual objects as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font17"> changes, sometimes to a real and actual relationship to our real psychophysical subjectivity and sometimes, finally, to the latter itself. But now we must describe what is left of that as a phenomenological residuum if</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question marks opposite this sentence in Cof</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">)</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">y A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">we reduce it to its &quot;pure immanence'' and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">what therefore may</span><span class="font17"> or may not </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">hold good for the really inherent component of the pure mental process.</span><span class="font17"> And here it must be made perfectly clear that, more particularly, there belongs to the essence of the mental process of perception in itself the <sup>tk</sup>perceived tree as perceived,&quot; or the full noema, which is not touched by excluding the actuality of the tree and that of the whole world; on the other hand, however, this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noema,</span><span class="font17"> with its &quot;tree&quot; in inverted commas, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is no more contained inherently than is the tree which belongs to actuality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What do we find really inherent in &lt;the perception&gt; as pure mental process, contained in it as the parts, the pieces and the moments not divisible into pieces, of a whole? We have, on occasion, distinguished such genuine really inherent component parts by the names</span><span class="font7">。姑 </span><span class="font17">component parts and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noetic</span><span class="font17"> component parts. Let us contrast them with the noematic components.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The color of the tree trunk, pure as the color of which we are perceptually conscious, is precisely the &quot;same&quot; as the one which, before the phenomenological reduction, we took to be the color of the actual tree (at least as &quot;natural&quot; human beings and prior to intervention of information provided by physics). Now, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">this color</span><span class="font17">put into parenthesis, belongs to the noema. But it does not belong to the mental process of perception as a really inherent component piece, although we can also find in it ''something like color:^^ namely, the &quot;sensed color,&quot; that hyletic moment of the concrete mental process by which the noematic, or &quot;objective,'' color is &quot;adumbrated.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Accordingly, however, one and the same noematic color which is intended to throughout the continuous unity of changeable perceptual consciousness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font17"> an identical and, in itself unchanged color, &lt;203&gt; is being adumbrated by a continuous multiplicity of sensed colors. \Ve see a tree unchanged with respect to color — its color, the color of the tree — while the positions of the eyes &lt;and our&gt; relative orientat-</span><span class="font7">】</span><span class="font17">ons are changing and our regard is incessantly moving over the trunk and branches, and while, at the same time, we come closer and thus, in various ways, bring the mental process of perception into a flow. Let us reflect on sensations, on adumbrations: we then seize <sup>u</sup>pon them as evident data and, in perfect evidence, changing the Scus and direction of attention, we can also relate them and the corresponding objective moments, cognize them as corresponding and, in so doing, see at once that, eg, the adumbrative colors pertaining to any fixed physical-thing color are related to it as a</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">continuous &quot;multiplicity'' is related to a &quot;unity.&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Effecting the phenomenological reduction, we even acquire the generical eidetic insight that the object, tree, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can only</span><span class="font17"> appear </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">at all</span><span class="font17"> in a perception as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Objectively</span><span class="font17"> determined in the mode in which it does appear in the perception if the hyletic moments (or, in the case of a continuous series of perceptions, if the continuous hyletic changes) arejust those and no others. This therefore implies that any changes<sup>3 </sup>of the hyletic content of the perception, if it does not quite do away with perceptual consciousness, must at least result in what appears becoming objectively &quot;other,&quot; whether in itself or in the orientation in which it is appearing, or the like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is also absolutely indubitable, then, that here &quot;unity&quot; and &quot;multiplicity&quot; belong to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">wholly different dimensions</span><span class="font17"> and, more particularly, that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">everything hyletic</span><span class="font17"> belongs in the concrete mental process as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">really inherent</span><span class="font17"> component, whereas, in contrast, what is &quot;presented,&quot; &quot;adumbrated,&quot; in it as multiplicity belongs in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noema.<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But the stuffs, we said earlier, are &quot;animated&quot; by noetic moments; they undergo (while the Ego is turned, not to them, but to the object) &quot;construingsj &quot;sense-bestowals,'' which, in reflections, we seize upon precisely in and along with the stuffs. In view of this it immediately follows that not only the hyletic moments (the sensed colors, sounds, etc.), but also the animating construals ——thus </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">both together,</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">appearing</span><span class="font17"> of the color, the sound and thus of any quality &lt;204) whatever of the object — belong to the &quot;'really inherent&quot; composition of the mental process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now, the following is universally true: In itself the perception is a perception of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font17"> object; and to every component which is singled out in the object by &quot;objectively'' directed description there correspond a really inherent component of the perception; but, note well, only in so far as the description faithfully conforms to the object </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as it ^is there&quot; in that</span><span class="font17"> perception itself. Moreover, we can designate all those noetic components only by appealing to the noematic Object and its moments: thus saying, for example, consciousness, more particularly, perceptual consciousness, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font17"> a tree trunk, of the color of the trunk, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the other hand, our considerations have shown indeed that the really inherent unity within the mental process ofhyletic and noetic component pieces is totally different from the &lt;unity&gt; of noematic component pieces &quot;intended to&quot; in the noesis; and it is also different from the unity which unites all those really inherent components in the mental process with that whereof, as a noema, we are conscious in and through them. That which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>Ci</sup>transcendentally constituted&quot;</span><span class="font17"> <sup>4</sup>'on the ground of<sup>9</sup> the material </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[stofflicK]</span><span class="font17"> mental processes &quot;by&quot; the noetic functions is, to be sure, something &quot;given;&quot; ' and in pure intuition we laithfully describe the mental process and its noematic object intended to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[sein noematisch Bewufites]</span><span class="font17">, it is something </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">evidently</span><span class="font17"> given; but it belongs to the mental process in a sense entirely different from the sense in which the really inherent and therefore proper constituents belong to the mental process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The characterization of the phenomenological reduction and, likewise, of the pure sphere of mental processes as &quot;transcendental&quot; rests precisely on the fact that we discover in this reduction an absolute sphere of stuffs and noetic forms whose determinately structured combinations possess, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">according to immanental eidetic necessity,</span><span class="font17"> the marvelous consciousness of something determinate and determinable, given thus and so, which is something over against consciousness itself, something fundamentally other, non-really inherent </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Irreelles],</span><span class="font17"> transcendent; &lt;the characterization of mental processes as &quot;transcendental&quot; further rests on the fact&gt; that this is the primal source in which is found the only conceivable solution of those deepest problems of cognition concerning the essence and possibility of an objectively valid knowledge of something transcendent. &quot;Transcendental&quot; reduction exercises the Mo%f| with respect to actuality: but what it retains of &lt;actuality&gt; includes the noemas with the noematic unity included within them themselves and, accordingly, the mode in which something real is intended to and, in particular, given in consciousness itself. The knowledge that everywhere it is a matter of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic,</span><span class="font17"> therefore unconditioned, necessary concatenations opens up a great field of research into the eidetic</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">205</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">relations between the noetic and the noematic, between the mental process of consciousness and the correlate of consciousness. The latter term, however, includes: consciousness ofobjectivity as consciousness ofobjectivity and, at the same time, the forms of the noematic How of mcantness of givenness. Within the domain from which we have taken our example, there arises, first of all, the universal evidence</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">that perception is not an empty presentive having of the object, but that instead it belongs (&quot;a priori&quot;) to the essence proper of perception to have &quot;its&quot; object, and to have it as the unity of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">certain </span><span class="font17">noematic composition which is always a different, yet always eidet-ically predelineated composition in the case of other perceptions of &quot;the same^^ object; or that it is of the essence of the object in question, objectively determined thus and so, to be and only to be able to be a noematic object precisely in perceptions of such a descriptive sort, etc.<sup>5</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Important supplementations are still, however, necessary. First of all, it must be carefully noted that any transition from a phenomenon into the reflection which itself is an analysis of the really inherent, or into the quite differently articulated &lt;reflection&gt; which dissects its noema, generates new phenomena, and that we would fall into error were we to confuse the new phenomena — which, in a certain way, are recastings of the old — with the old phenomena, and were we to impute to the old what really inherently or noematically is included in the &lt;new&gt;. Thus it is not meant, e.g., that the material contents, let us say the adumbrative color-contents, are present in the perceptual mental process in just the same way in which they are present in the mental process of analyzing. To mention only one</span><span class="font12">〈</span><span class="font17">difference,</span><span class="font12">》</span><span class="font17">in the former they were contained as really inherent moments, but they were not perceived therein, not seized upon as objects. But in the analyzing mental process they are objects, targets of noetic functions which were not present before. Although these stuffs are still laden with their presentive functions, even these have undergone essential changes (to be sure, of other dimensions). That will be discussed later. Obviously, this difference has an essential importance for the phenomenological method.</span></p>

It holds for all originarily presentive acts: To each fundamental kind of objectivity there corresponds an eidetically appertinent fundamental kind of constitutive &lt;consciousness&gt; originaliter -- i.e., consciousness presentive originaliter of just that &lt;objectivity&gt; and no other - and eidetically this consciousness has its quite determinate structures the exploration of which is the task.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Following this remark let us turn our attention to the following points belonging to our particular theme. In the first place, every</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">206</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">mental process is so structured that there exists the essential possibliL ity of turning one's regard to it and its really inherent components and, likewise, in the opposite direction to the noema, perchance to the seen tree as seen. That which is given in this focusing of regard is now, more particularly, stated logically, an object, but utterly </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">nonselfsufficient.</span><span class="font17"> Its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">esse</span><span class="font17"> consists exclusively of its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">percip^</span><span class="font17"> ——except that this proposition does not have the Berkeleyian sense because here the esse does not include the percipi as a really inherent component piece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This is naturally transferred to the eidetic mode of consideration: the Eidos of the noema points to the Eidos of the noetic consciousness; both belong together </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetically.</span><span class="font17"> The intentive as intentive </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Intentionale als solches}</span><span class="font17"> is what it is as the intentiveness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Intentionales]</span><span class="font17"> belonging to consciousness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">structured</span><span class="font17"> thus and so, consciousness which is consciousness of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In spite of this non-selfsufficiency the noema allows for being considered by itself compared with other noemas, explored with respect to its possible transformations, etc. One<sup>7</sup> can project a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">theory of the universal and pure forms ofnoemata</span><span class="font17"> which would have as its contrasting </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">correlate</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">theory</span><span class="font17"> of the universal and no less pure </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">forms of concrete noetic mental processes</span><span class="font17"> with their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">hyletic</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">specifically noetic</span><span class="font17"> components.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Naturally these two theories would </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">by no means</span><span class="font17"> be related as, so to speak, mutual </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reflections}</span><span class="font17"> nor would the one be transformed into the other by a mere change of sign, let us say, by substituting ''consciousness of N&quot; for each noema N. That already follows from what we explained before in connection with the way in which unitary qualities belong together in the physical thing — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noema</span><span class="font17"> with their hyletic adumbration-multiplicities contained in possible perceptions of physical things.<sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It would now seem as though the same would also be true with respect to the specifically noetic moments. More particularly, one can refer to those moments which bring it about that a complex multiplicity of hyletic Data, eg, color-Data, etc., acquire the fiinc-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">tion of a manifold adumbration of one and the same objective physical thing. Indeed, it only need be recalled that in the stuffs themselves, by virtue of their own essence, the relation to the Objective unity is not unambiguously predelineated; the same material complex, instead, can undergo a diversity of mutually discrete and shifting construings by virtue of which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">different</span><span class="font17"> ob-&lt;207&gt; jectivities are intended to. Is it not therefore already clear that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essential differences</span><span class="font17"> lie </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the animating construings themselves</span><span class="font17"> as moments of mental processes, and which are differentiated along with the attendant adumbrations and by virtue of the animation of which they constitute &quot;sense&quot;? One may therefore draw the following conclusion: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">X parellelism</span><span class="font17"> between noesis and noema is indeed the case, but it is such that one must describe the formations </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">on both sides</span><span class="font17"> and in their essentially mutual correspondence. The noematic is the field of unities, the noetic is the field of &quot;constituting&quot; multiplicities. The consciousness which unities the manifold &quot;functionally'' and, at the same time, constitutes unity </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font17"> in fact shows an identity<sup>9</sup> even where an identity of the &quot;o </span><span class="font7">切 </span><span class="font17">ect&quot; is given in the noematic correlate. Where, for example, different segments of an enduring perceiving which is constituting a physical-thingunity showssomethingidentical, the one tree unchanging according to the sense of this perceiving — given now in this, then in that orientation, now from the front, now from the back, at first indistinctly and indeterminately, then distinctly and determinately with respect to the properties of one or another place seized upon visually — : there the object found in the noema is intended to as an identical object in the literal sense, but the consciousness of it is a non-identical, only combined, continuously united consciousness in the different segments of its immanental duration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">No matter to what extent these statements contain something right, the conclusions drawn are still not wholly correct; indeed, the greatest caution is required in dealing with these difficult questions. The parallelisms obtaining here </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">and there are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mariy</span><span class="font17"> which are only too easily confused with one another — involve great difficulties which are still in need of clarification. We must carefully keep in view the difference between concrete noetic mental processes, the mental processes together with their hyletic moments, and the pure noeses as mere complexes of noetic moments. Again, we must preserve the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">distinction between the full noema and, e.g., in the case of perception, the ''appearing object as appearing.&quot; If we take this <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>object<sup>,? </sup>and all its objective “predicates&quot;——the noematic modifications of the predicates of the perceived physical thing, posited in normal perception simply as actual predicates — then this object and these predicates are indeed unities in contradistinction to multiplicities of constituting mental processes of consciousness (concrete noeses). But they are also unities of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic</span><span class="font17"> multiplicities. We recognize that as &lt;208&gt; soon as we take into consideration the noematic characterizations of the noematic &quot;object&quot; (and its &quot;predicates&quot;), characterizations which until now we have grossly neglected. Thus it is certain, for instance, that the appearing color is a unity in contradistinction to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noetic</span><span class="font17"> multiplicities and, specifically, multiplicities of noetic construing-characteristics. But more precise investigations reveal that changes in these characteristics correspond to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic</span><span class="font17"> parallels —- if not in the &quot;color itself<sub>&gt;</sub>^^ which continues to appear there, then at least in their changing &quot;modes of givenness,<sup>,?</sup> e.g., in their appearing &quot;orientation with respect to me.&quot; In this way, then noetic&quot; characterizations&quot; are mirrored in the noematic ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">How</span><span class="font17"> that is the case, and not simply for the sphere of perception emphasized here by way of example, must now become a theme of comprehensive analyses. We shall analyze in sequence the different kinds of consciousness with their many different noetic characteristics and explore them with respect to their notic-noematic parallels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In advance, however, we must impress upon ourselves that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">parallelism</span><span class="font17"> between the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unity of the object noematically &quot;meant'' in such and such </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> way,</span><span class="font17"> the unity of the object in the &quot;sense,'' and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">constituting formations of</span><span class="font17"> consciousness (&quot;ordo et connexio rerum </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">ordo et connexio idearum&quot;) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">must not be confused with the parallelism between noesis and noema,</span><span class="font17"> understood more particularly as the parallelism of noetic and corresponding noematic characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The following considerations concern the latter parallelism.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§99 . The Noematic Core and Its Characteristics in the Sphere of Original Presentations and Presentiations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">It is our task, therefore, to considerably broaden the sphere of what has been exhibited in the two parallel series of noetic and noematic events in order to arrive at the full noema and the full noesis. What</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">previously we had in view, although without suspecting the great problems it contains, is indeed only a central core and, in addition, not even an unambiguously delimited one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us recall,<sup>10</sup> in the first place, that &quot;objective sense&quot; which, by &lt;209&gt; comparing the noemata of different </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sorts</span><span class="font17"> of objectivations, of perceptions, of memories, picture-ohgectivations, and the like, previously proved to be something describable exclusively with Objective expressions and even with identical ones in the preferentially chosen limiting cases in which a wholly like object — oriented in a like way, apprehended in a like way in every respect </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">e.g., a tree, is presented perceptually, memorially, pictorially, etc. In contrast to the identical ''appearing tree as appearing,<sup>M</sup> with its identical &quot;Objective'' How of appearing, there remain the differences in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">modes of givenness</span><span class="font17"> varying from one kind of intuition to another kind and in accordance with other sorts of objectivation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">That which is identical is at one time intended to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'&quot;orginarily^</span><span class="font17"> at another time </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^memorially^</span><span class="font17"> then &quot;pictorially,'' etc. In that connection, however, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">characteristics,</span><span class="font17"> found when one's regard is directed to the noematic correlate and not to the mental process and its really inherent composition, are indicated in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'&quot;appearing tree as appear-ing</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">：</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> Expressed, accordingly, are not </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;modes of consciousness^</span><span class="font17"> in the sense of noetic moments, but rather </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">modes in which the object itself intended to and as intended</span><span class="font17"> fo is given. As characteristics belonging to what is, so to speak, &quot;ideally inherent&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[^Ideellen^],</span><span class="font17"> they are themselves &quot;ideal''</span><span class="font7">「'泌</span><span class="font17">e</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">‘‘] and not really inherent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Upon more precise analysis one observes that the characteristics mentioned as examples do not belong to a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">single</span><span class="font17"> series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the one side we have the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reproductive</span><span class="font17"> modification simpliciter, the presentiation simpliciter, which, in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its own essence,</span><span class="font17"> remarkably enough, is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">given </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">$ modification of something else.</span><span class="font17"> Presentiation refers back to perception in its own peculiar phenomenological essence</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> eg, as we have already noted before, remembering something past implies &quot;having perceived;'' thus in a certain fashion the &quot;coire-sponding&quot; perception (perception of the same sense-core) is intended to in the memory, although it is not actually contained in it. Precisely in its own peculiar essence, memory is a <sup>s4</sup>modification of<sup>5</sup> perception. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Correlatively^</span><span class="font17"> what is characterized as past in itself is presented as &quot;having been present,<sup>M</sup> thus as a modification of the “present&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">which as the unmodified, is precisely the &quot;originary,&quot; the &quot;present in person<sup>55</sup> of the perception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the other side, the</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pictorializing</span><span class="font17"> modification belongs to another series of modifications. It presen tiates &quot;in&quot; a &quot;picture.&quot; However, the picture can be an originarily appearing one, e.g., the &quot;painted&quot; picture which we seize upon perceptually (obviously not the painting </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">3S physical</span><span class="font17"> ^Aizi^ of which it is said, e.g., that it hangs on the wall<sup>11</sup>). But the picture can also be something which appears reproductively, as when we have picture-objectivations in memory or in free phantasy.<sup>12</sup></span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;2l0&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">At the same time one observes that the characteristics of this new series are not only related back to the first series, but also presuppose combinations: the latter &lt;presupposed&gt; with reference back to the difference between &quot;picture&quot; and &quot;depictured&quot; which noematically belongs to the essence of consciousness. One sees too, on that account, that here the noema always includes a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pair</span><span class="font17"> of characteristics which refer to one another even though they include differing objects as objects of objectivatings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Finally, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sign-objectivations,</span><span class="font17"> with their analogous opposites of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sign </span><span class="font17">and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">designated,</span><span class="font17"> offer us a closely related and nonetheless new type of modifying noematic characteristics (to which, as everywehere, there correspond parallel noetic characteristics); accordingly, again combinations of objectivations occur, and, as correlates of their own peculiar unity as sign-objectivations, pairs of characterizations which belong together noematically occur in the noematic objectpairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One also notes that just as the &quot;picture&quot; [&quot;8</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">&quot;''] in itself, according to its sense as image </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Bild],</span><span class="font17"> is given as the modification of something which, without this modification would be there itself simply as &quot;in person<sup>55</sup> or as presentiated, so the &quot;sign&quot; &lt;is given&gt;, but, in its fashion, likewise as the modification of something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">§/00. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Eidetically Lawful Hierarchical Formations of Objectivations in the Noesis and Noema.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">All the types of objectivation-modifications previously dealt with are always accessible for always newer hierarchical formations of such a</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">kind that the intentionalities in the noesis and noema are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">hierarchically </span><span class="font17">built up on one another or, rather, in a unique way, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">encased in one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">There are presentations simpliciter,</span><span class="font17"> modifications simpliciter of perceptions. But there are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sAso presentiations of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> second, third and, essentially, </span><span class="font17">J</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ariy level whatever.</span><span class="font17"> Rememberings &quot;in&quot; rememberings will serve as an example. Living in the remembering we &quot;effect” a concatenation of mental processes in the mode of presentiation. We persuade ourselves of this by reflecting &quot;in” the remembering (which, for its &lt;211&gt; part, is a presentiation-modification of an originary reflecting), and we then find the concatenations of mental processes characterized as memorially &quot;having been lived.&quot; Whether we reflect on them or not, among mental processes characterized that way rememberings can themselves now occur characterized as &quot;rememberings having been lived,&quot; and the regard can be directed through them to the remembered at the second level. In the secondarily modified concatenation of mental processes, rememberings can arise once again, and thus idealiter in infinitum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A mere change of sign (the own specific peculiarity of which we must yet learn to understand) translates </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> of these events into the type, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">free phantasy,</span><span class="font17"> so that phantasyings into phantasyings are yielded, and this at any level of encasement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Moreover, there are then </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mixtures</span><span class="font17"> of them. It is not only the case that each presentiation, according to its essence, with respect to the next level below it, includes presentiation-modifications </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of perceptions </span><span class="font17">which become the object of a seizing regard by the wonderful &lt;process&gt; of reflection in presentiation; in the unity of the presentiation-phenomenon we can find at the same time, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">besides </span><span class="font17">presentiations of perceptions, presentiations of rememberings, expectations, phantasyings, etc., whereby the presentiations in question can be themselves of any of these types. And all of this &lt;is fbund&gt; at different levels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This also holds for the types of combinations, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">depictive</span><span class="font17"> objectivation and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sign-objectivation.</span><span class="font17"> Let us take an example with a very complicated and yet easily understandable objectivation-fbrmation belonging to objectivations of higher level. A name reminds us, namingly, of the Dresden Gallery and of our last visit there: we walk through the halls and stand before a picture by Teniers which represents a picture gallery. If, let us say, we allow that pictures in the latter would represent again pictures which, for their part, represent legible</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">inscriptions, and so forth, then we can estimate which inclusion of objectivations and which mediacies are actually produceable with respect to objectivities which can be seized upon. But such very complicated examples are not required for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic insights,</span><span class="font17"> in particular for the insight into the ideal possibility for continuing ad libitum the encasement ofone objectivation into another.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§101 . Characteristics of Levels. Different Sorts of<sup>(i</sup> Reflectionsy</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">It is clear that in all those kinds of hierarchical structures which contain reiterated presentiation-modifications in their members, &lt;212&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noemas with</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">corresponding hierarchical formation</span><span class="font17"> are constituted. In the consciousness of a depicturing at the second level a &quot;picture&quot; in itself is characterized as a picture at the second level, as picture of a picture. If we recall how yesterday we remembered a childhood experience, then the noema, &quot;childhood experience,” in itself has a characterization as something remembered at the second level. Thus in general:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To every noematic level there belongs a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">characteristic appropriate to that level</span><span class="font17"> as a kind of index with which each thing characterized manifests itself as belonging to its level — whether it would otherwise be a primary object or one lying in some line or other of the reflective regard. For indeed </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">to every level belong possible reflections at that level,</span><span class="font17"> so that, eg, with respect to remembered things at the second level of remembering, &lt;there are&gt; reflections on perceivings of just these things belonging to the same level (thus presentiated at the second level).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Furthermore: each noematic level is an &quot;objectivation&quot;</span><span class="font7">&quot;矿'</span><span class="font17">the data of the following &lt;level&gt;. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;ObjecEation”</span><span class="font17"> does not signify here, however, the objectivation-process, and the &quot;of&quot; does not express here the relation of consciousness and the Object of consciousness. It is, as it were, a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic in contrast to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> noetic intentionality.<sup>13</sup></span><span class="font17"> The latter includes in itself the former as its consciousness-correlate, and its intentionality, in a certain way, goes clear through the line of noematic intentionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This will become more distinct when we allow the Ego's attentive</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">regard to be directed to the consciousness of something objective. The &lt;Ego<sup>5</sup>s regard&gt; then goes straight </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">through</span><span class="font17"> the noemata of the sequence of levels — until it arrives at the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Object of the ultimate &lt;level&gt; </span><span class="font17">beyond which it cannot go, but upon which, instead, it fixes. The regard can, however, shift from </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">level to level,</span><span class="font17"> and instead of going through all of them it is rather directed to the data of that level upon which it fixes; it &lt;can do this&gt; either in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^straightforward'</span><span class="font17"> or in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reflective direction of regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the previous example</span><span class="font11">：</span><span class="font17"> the regard can remain at the level of the Dresden Gallery — &quot;rememberingly&quot; we walk through the Gallery in Dresden. Then we can, again within memory, live in the observation of pictures and find ourselves in the world of pictures. After this, adverted to the gallery of paintings in picture consciousness of the second level, we look at the paintings themselves; or we reflect hierarchically upon the noeses, etc.<sup>14</sup> This multiplicity of possible &lt;213&gt; directions of the regard essentially belongs to the multiplicity of intentionalities related to and founded in one another; and wherever we find analogous founding relationships ——and in what follows we will become acquainted with many very different kinds— analogous </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">possibilities of changing reflection</span><span class="font17"> are brought out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It need not be said that these relations require scientifically detailed explorations with respect to their essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">§/02. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Transition to New Dimensions of Characterizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With respect to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> of the specifically peculiar characterizations which we encountered in complex domains of modifications through presentiations, we </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font17"> clearly distinguish, on grounds already indicated, between the noetic and the noematic. The noematic &quot;ob</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> jects&quot; — the picture-Object, or the depictured Object, the &lt;Object&gt; functioning as sign and the designated &lt;Ohject&gt;, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">disregarding</span><span class="font17"> the characterizations belonging to them such as &quot;picture fb^,^^ &quot;depictured,&quot; &quot;sign fbrj &quot;designated&quot; — are unities transcendent to, but evidentially intended to in, the mental process. But if that is the case, then characteristics,<sup>15</sup> which arise </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font17"> &lt;those unities&gt; for consciousness and which are seized upon as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font17"> properties in focusing the regard on them, cannot possibly be regarded as really inherent moments of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">mental process. No matter how difficult the problems may still be in how both — that which is a really inherent composition of the mental process and that which is intended to in the mental process as not really inherent in it — may stand with respect to one another, we must make the differentiation throughout. More particularly, &lt;we must make it&gt; not only with respect to the noematic core, the &quot;intentional object as intentional&quot; (and taken in its &quot;Objective&quot; modes of givenness), which emerges in the particular case as the bearer of the noematic &quot;characteristics J but also as well with respect to the characteristics themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There are, however, still quite different sorts of characteristics which always attach to the noematic core, and the ways in which they pertain to &lt;the core&gt; are very different. They find their place within</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fundamentally different genera,</span><span class="font17"> within, so to speak, fundamentally different </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">dimensions of characterization.</span><span class="font17"> On that account, it may be pointed out at the very beginning that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> of the characteristics suggested here or still to be suggested (mere headings of necessary analytic-descriptive research) are of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all-embracing phenomenological scope.</span><span class="font17"> When we also deal with them immediately, primarily in the case of the relatively simplest structured mental processes which comprise a determined and fundamental concept of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^objectivation^ </span><span class="font17">and which make up necessary foundations for all other intentive</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">214</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">mental processes, then these same fundamental genera and species of characteristics are also to be found among all these founded and, therefore, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">among all intentive mental processes whatever.</span><span class="font17"> The situation is such that, accordingly, always and necessarily a noematic core, an <sup>&lt;t</sup>object-noema,^^ is intended to which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font17"> be characterized in some manner and, moreover, according to this or that (on its side, exclusive) species in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">each</span><span class="font17"> genus.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§103. Belief-characteristics and Being-characteristics.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">If we look about for new characteristics we notice, first of all, that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being-characteristics</span><span class="font17"> are combined with those obviously totally different characteristics we dealt with before. As noetic characteristics related to correlative modes of being — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;doxic&quot;</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;belt# characteristics^</span><span class="font17"> — we find perceptual belief and, sometimes, to be sure, perceptual certainty, really inherently included in intuitive objec-tivations, eg, in those of normal perceptions as &quot;attentive percep-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">tions</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17">'' corresponding to &lt;perceptual certainty&gt; as its noematic correlate belonging to the appearing object is the being-characteristic: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;actual</span><span class="font17">The same noetic or noematic characteristic is shown by &quot;certain&quot; representiation, by every sort of &quot;$</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">&quot;' mindfulness of something which was, or is now, or which will be in the future (as in the case of anticipated expectation). They are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being-'positing^ ^positional</span><span class="font17"> acts. To be sure, we must note concerning this expression that if it refers also to an actus, to a position-taking in a specific sense, precisely this is left out of consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the sphere considered up to now, that which appears perceptually or memorially had the characteristic of &quot;actually” existing simpliciter — of &quot;certainly'' existing as we also say in contrast to other being-characteristics. For this characteristic can become modified; it can become transformed, perhaps, in the same phenomenon by actual modifications, The mode of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^certain&quot; belief</span><span class="font17"> can change into the mode of mere </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">deeming possible</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">deeming likely,</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">questioning</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doubting;</span><span class="font17"> and, as the case may be, that which appears (and which, with regard to the first dimension of characterizations is characterized as &quot;originary,'' &quot;reproductive J and the like has taken on now the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being-modalities of<sup>c&lt;</sup>possible/' of probable,&quot; of ^questionable/' of<sup>((</sup>doubtful.^</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For example: at first a perceived object is there with simple &lt;215&gt; unquestionedness, in certainty. Suddenly we suspect that we may have fallen victim to a mere &quot;illusion J we suspect that what is seen, heard, and the like, may be &quot;mere semblance.<sup>J,</sup> Or what is appearing keeps its being-certainty, but we are unsure about some deter-minational complex or other. The thing<sup>4</sup>'suggests itself as possibly a man. Then a contrary deeming possible occurs: it could be a tree which, in the darkness of the forest, looks like a man who is moving. Now, however, the &quot;weight'' of the one &quot;possibility'' becomes considerably greater; we decide in its favor, perhaps in the manner in which we definitely deem it likely that <sup>4&lt;</sup>it was a tree after all.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Being-modalities likewise change even more frequently in memory and, more particularly, they change such that, in a large measure, they are set up and replaced within the bounds of intuitions, or of obscure ohjectivations, without the participation of any &quot;thinking” in the specific sense, without a &quot;concept&quot; and predicative judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At the same time, one sees that the relevant phenomena suggest various studies, that many further characteristics (like </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;decided</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">' ^weights&quot;</span><span class="font17"> of possibilities, and the like) make their appearance here,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">and that, in particular, the question about the essential foundations of the various characteristics, the question about the whole structure of noemas and noeses governed by eidetic laws, also requires profbunder investigations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And here, as elsewhere, it is sufficient to have brought out<sup>16</sup> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">group of problems.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">§704. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Doxic Modalities as Modifications.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">But with respect to the series of belief-modalities specifically occupying us, we must still point out that, in the pre-eminent </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">specific intentional sense of the word, modification</span><span class="font17"> again finds the application which we made distinct for ourselves in the analysis of the previous series of noetic or noematic characteristics. In the present series beliefcertainty obviously plays the role of the unmodified or, as we had to say here, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>((</sup>unmodalized&quot; primal form</span><span class="font7"> ^ 於 </span><span class="font17">e </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mode of believing.</span><span class="font17"> Corre-latively, in the correlate: the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being-characteristic simpliciter</span><span class="font17"> (the noematically &quot;certain'' or &quot;actually&quot; existing) functions as the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">primal form &lt;from which all being-modalities &lt;are derived&gt;.</span><span class="font17"> In fact, all of the beingcharacteristics originating from it, the ones, to be </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">specifically called </span><span class="font17">being-modalities, have in their own sense a relation back to the primal form. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">In</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">$e</span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> &quot;possible&quot; is tantamount to &quot;possibly existing;'' &quot;probable,&quot; &quot;doubtfill,'' &quot;questionable&quot; are tantamount to &quot;prob</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> ably existing,<sup>5,</sup> ^doubtfully and questionably existing.<sup>5,</sup> The intentionality of the noeses is mirrored in these noematic respects </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Beziehungen],</span><span class="font17"> and one feels oneself forced to speak again even of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>C(</sup>noematic intentionality&quot;'</span><span class="font17"> as a &quot;parallel'' of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noetic</span><span class="font17"> &lt;intentionality&gt;, which is &lt;intentionality&gt; properly so called.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;216&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">All of this is transferred to the full </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;posita^</span><span class="font17"> i.e., to the unities of sense-core and being-characteristic.<sup>17</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is convenient, besides, to employ the term &quot;being</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17">modality'' for the whole series of the being-characteristics, thus also for unmodified &quot;being&quot; wherever this is to be considered </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> member of this series —— </span><span class="font17">perhaps similar to the way in which the arithmetician also includes &quot;ones&quot; under the name number. In the same sense, we universalize the sense of the phrase, doxic modalities, under which we comprise,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">often consciously with a double significancy, the noetic and noematic parallels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Furthermore, in the designation of unmodalized being as &quot;being certain,<sup>?,</sup> one should heed the equivocation of the word &quot;certain J &quot;certainty&quot;</span><span class="font7">「'</span><span class="font17">ge</span><span class="font7">出步''], </span><span class="font17">and not only with respect to its signifying sometimes noetic, sometimes noematic &quot;being certain.<sup>?,</sup> It also serves (and here this is very misleading) to express, eg, the correlate of affirmation: &quot;yes&quot; as the opposite of &quot;no&quot; and &quot;not.&quot; This must remain strictly excluded here. The significations of words continually shift within the bounds of immediate logical equivalence. But our task is to bring to light everywhere the equivalences, and to sharply seperate what lies behind them in essentially different phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Belief-certainty is beliefsimpliciter in the pregnant sense. It has, in fact, according to our analyses a highly remarkable special place in the multiplicity of acts all of which are comprehended under the title of belief——or &quot;judgment&quot; as is frequently but unsuitably said. A proper expression is needed which takes account of this special place and blots out every memory of the conventional placing of certainty and other belief-modes on a par. We introduce the term </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">primal belief orprotodoxa,</span><span class="font17"> by which the intentional retrorelatedness, elaborated by &lt;21 7&gt; us, of all &quot;belieRmodalities&quot; is suitably expressed. We add further that we shall use this latter expression (or &quot;doxic modality^<sup>,</sup>) for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font17">intentional variants grounded in the essence of protodoxa, even for those </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font17"> ones to be brought out in the following analyses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We scarcely require a critique of the basically false theory according to which a genus, ''belief<sup>3</sup> (or &quot;judgment&quot;) is only differentiated into certainty, uncertain presumption, etc., as though it were a matter there of a series of coordinate species (no matter where the series is broken ofT)——just as color, sound, etc., are coordinate species in the genus, sensuous quality. In addition, we must refrain here, as elsewhere, from pursuing the consequences of what we have ascertained phenomenologically.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§105. Belief-modality as Belief, Being-modality as Being.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Ig with respect to the highly remarkable situation described above, we speak of an intentionality whereby the secondary modes relate back to proto-doxa, the sense of this locution requires the possibility of multiple directions of regard of the kind which universally belong</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">to the essence of intentionality at a higher level. The possibility indeed exists. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">On the one hand,</span><span class="font17"> we can, e.g., while living in probabilityconsciousness (in the deeming likely) look at </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font17"> is probable; on the other hand, we can, however, &lt;look at&gt; the probable itself as probable, that is, at the noematic Object </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as having</span><span class="font17"> the characteristic alloted to it by the deeming-likely noesis. The &quot;Object,'' however, with its sence-composition and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font17"> this probability-characteristic, is given as existing </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the second focusing of regard:</span><span class="font17"> in relation to this, accordingly, consciousness is simple belief in the unmodified sense. Likewise we can live in possibility-consciousness (in the &quot;deeming possible<sup>55</sup>), or in questioning and doubting, our regard being directed to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font17"> we are conscious of there as possible, questionable, doubtful. But we can also look at the possible, the questionable, doubtful as possible, questionable, doubtful and then, perhaps explicitly, seize upon the being possible, the being questionable, the being doubtful, predicating them of the sense-Object: the latter then is given as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being </span><span class="font17">in the unmodified sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus quite universally we can observe the highly remarkable eidetic peculiarity that, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in relation to all the noetic moments the&quot;'intentional Object&quot; as &quot;&nbsp;Object'<sup>9</sup> is constituted as having by means of its noeses, every mental</span><span class="font17"> &lt;218&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">process functions as belief-consciousness in the sense ofprotodoxa;</span><span class="font17"> or, as we can also say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is not the case that only new noematic characteristics are constituted by the new supervening noetic characteristics or by modifications of old ones; instead, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">new Objects posited as existent</span><span class="font17"> are therewith eo ipso constituted for consciousness; to the noematic characteristics correspond predicable characteristics in the senseObject as actual and not merely noematically modified predicables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">These propositions will acquire further clarity when we have made ourselves familiar with new noematic spheres.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§106. Affirmation and Denial Along With Their Noematic Correlates.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Again a new retrorelated modification and, moreover, one which is possibly on a higher level by virtue of its essential intentional relation back to belief-modalities of every sort, is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">rejection</span><span class="font17"> as well as its analogue, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">assent.</span><span class="font17"> Expressed more specifically: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">denial</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">affirmation.</span><span class="font17"> Every denial is denial of something, and this something refers us back to some belief<sup>1</sup> modality or other. Noetically, therefore, negation is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;modification'' of some &quot;position&quot; or other; that does not signify an affirmation but instead a &quot;positing&quot; in the extended sense of some belief-modality or other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Its new </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic</span><span class="font17"> effect is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;cancellation”</span><span class="font17"> of the corresponding posited characteristic, its specific correlate is the cancellation-characteristic, the characteristic of &quot;ziof.&quot; The line of negation goes through something positional, more concretely stated, through a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;positum^ </span><span class="font17">and, more particularly, by virtue of the cancellation of a specific </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positum-characteristic,</span><span class="font17"> i.e., of its being-modality. Precisely on this account this characteristic and the positum itself are present as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^modifi-cation'&quot; of something else.</span><span class="font17"> Differently stated: by transmutation of the simple being-consciousness into the corresponding negationconsciousness, the simple characteristic &quot;existing&quot; becomes, in the noema, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">non-existing^</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Analogously, &quot;possible,&quot; &quot;probable,&quot; &quot;questionable,&quot; become &quot;impossible,&quot; &quot;improbable,&quot; unquestionable.<sup>,5</sup> And hence the whole noema, the whole </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;positum</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> taken in its concrete noematic fullness, becomes modified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Just as negation, metaphorically speaking, strikes out, so affirma-&lt;219&gt; tion </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;'underscores/'</span><span class="font17"> it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;confirms&quot; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> position by <sup>cc</sup>assenting'<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font17"> instead of &quot;annulling&quot; it as in negation. This too yields a series of noematic modifications parallel to the cancellation-modifications. We cannot follow up on this here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Up to now we have disregarded what is peculiar to the &quot;positiontaking&quot; of the pure Ego which, in the rejection, specifically here in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">negating</span><span class="font17"> &lt;rejection&gt;, is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>ci</sup>directed^ against</span><span class="font17"> what is rejected, against the being to be cancelled, just as in the affirmation &lt;the Ego&gt; is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">inclined toward</span><span class="font17"> what is affirmed, directed </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font17"> it. This descriptive side of the situation should also not be overlooked and requires its own analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Similarly, account is to be taken, again, of the circumstance that, with respect to the complexity of the intentionalities, different directions of the regard are always possible. We can live in the negating consciousness, in other words, <sup>&lt;t</sup>effect^^ the negation; the regard of the Ego is then directed to that which undergoes the cancellation. But we can also direct the regard as a seizing &lt;regard&gt; to the cancelled as cancelled, to that which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">bears the</span><span class="font17"> stamp of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">cancellation'.</span><span class="font17"> &lt;the cancelled&gt; is then there </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> new <sup>cc</sup>Object^</span><span class="font17"> and, to be sure, it is there </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the simple protodoxic mode as <sup>iC</sup>existing.^</span><span class="font17"> The new focusing does not generate the new Object posited as existent; in the &quot;effecting'' of the rejection</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">what is rejected is also intended to as having the characteristic of cancelledness; but it is only in the new focusing that the characteristic becomes the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">predicable determination</span><span class="font17"> of the noematic sense-core. Likewise the same is also true, naturally, of affirmation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The tasks of phenomenological eidetic analysis also lie, therefore, in this direction.<sup>18</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§107. Reiterated Modifications.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">What we have already appropriated by such analyses is sufficient to directly achieve the following advance of insight:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Since every negatum and affirmatum is itself an Object posited as existent, it can, like everything else intended to as having a mode of being, become affirmed or denied. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">In consequence of</span><span class="font17"> the constitution of something as existent effected anew at every step, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">an ideally infinite chain of reiterated modifications</span><span class="font17"> therefore results. Thus at the first level, &lt;220&gt; &quot;not non-existent,&quot; &quot;not impossibly existent,&quot; &quot;not unquestionably existent,&quot; &quot;not improbably existent,&quot; and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The same holds good, as is immediately seen, for all the modifications ofbeing discussed earlier. That something is possible, probable, questionable, and so forth, can itselfbe intended to again in the mode of possibility, probability, questionability, the noematic beingformations corresponding to the noetic formations: it is possible that it is possible, that it is probable, that it is questionable; and thus in all complexities. Affirmata and negata correspond to the formation of higher levels, they being modifiable anew, and thus it continues, ideally stated, in infinitum. It is a matter here of anything but mere verbal repetitions. We need only recall the theory of probability and its applications where possibilities and probabilities are continually weighed, denied, doubted, deemed likely, inquired into, ascertained, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But it should always be noted that the term modification refers, on the one hand, to a possible transmutation of the phenomena, thus to a possible actional operation; on the other hand, it refers to the much more interesting eidetic peculiarity of the noeses or to the noemas in</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">their pointing back to something other, something unmodified in their own essence, without any consideration of origin. But in both respects we stand on pure phenomenological grounds. For the terms transmutation and origin here refer to phenomenological eidetic occurences and in no way signify empirical mental processes as facts ofNature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">§/08. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Noematic Characteristics Not Determinations Produced by ^Reflections</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With each new group of noeses and noemas of which we have acquired clear consciousness, it is necessary that we also assure ourselves anew of the fundamental cognition so contrary to the habits of psychologistic thinking: that noesis and noema must be distinguished actually and correctly precisely to the extent demanded by faithful description. If one has already become accustomed to pure eidetic description of what is immanent (which so many have failed to do who otherwise prize description), and has brought himself in &lt;221</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">that connection to grant to every consciousness an intentional Object as belonging to it and describable in its immanence, the temptation is still great to construe the noematic characteristics, and above all the ones last dealt with, as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">determinations merely produced by ^reflections </span><span class="font17">Recalling the usually narrow concept of reflection, we understand what that signifies: Determinations which accrue to the intentional Objects by virtue of being referred back </span><span class="font7">切 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the modes</span><span class="font17"> J </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consciousness</span><span class="font17"> in which they are precisely Objects of consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus the negatum, the affirmatum, and the like, supposedly result because when relating reflection bears on the negating, on the affirming, likewise on the deeming likely, the ' judgment-''object is characterized as negated, as affirmed, as probable, and thus throughout. This is mere construction<sup>19</sup>already shown to be wrong by the fact that if these predicates were actually only predicates of relating reflection they could only be </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">given just</span><span class="font17"> in actual reflection on the act-side and in relating to it. It is evident, however, that they are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font17"> given by such reflection. We seize upon what is properly a matter of the correlate when we direct our regard directly and precisely to the correlate. We seize upon the negatum, the affirmatum, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">19 </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">author's footnote</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">：</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> cf. </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen,</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"> IP, 6.

<p><span class="font17">possible, the questionable, etc., the appearing object as appearing is constituted as having. Accordingly, in no way do we direct our regard back to the act. Conversely, the noetic predicates accruing by such reflection by no means have the same sense as the noematic predicates in question. Connected with this is the fact, therefore, that also from the standpoint </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">oitruth,</span><span class="font17"> non-being is obviously only equivalent to, and not identical with, <sup>4t</sup>being validly negated;^^ being possible &lt;is only equivalent to, and not identical with&gt; &quot;being accepted as possible in a valid way;” and the like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Natural language, undistorted by any psychological prejudice, provides a witness for us should we need it. Looking into the stereoscope, we say: this appearing pyramid is &quot;nothing,” is mere <sup>4t</sup>semblan-ce;” What is appearing as appearing is obviously the subject of predication and we ascribe to it (which is a physical thing-noema but not a physical thing) what we find present in it itself as a characteristic —precisely nullity. Here, as throughout phenomenology, one must have the courage to accept what is really to be seen in the phenomenon precisely as it presents itself rather than interpreting it away, and to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">honestly</span><span class="font17"> describe it. All theories must be directed accordingly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. The Neutrality Modification.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;222&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Among the modifications related to the sphere of belief we must still characterize a most important one which occupies a completely isolated place, therefore which need not be located in a series discussed above. If we dedicate a detailed consideration of it at this place, this is justified by the peculiar manner in which it is related to doxic positing and by the circumstance that it can only be discovered in its peculiarity with a more profound investigation -— as a highly significant </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universal</span><span class="font17"> modification of consciousness rather than one specifically belongingjust to the sphere ofbelief In this connection, we will also find the occasion to examine a kind of genuine beliefmodification still lacking to us, easily confused with the new modification in question: assumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is a matter, now, of a modification which, in a certain way, completely annuls, completely renders powerless every doxic modality to which it is related — but it is a modification in a totally different sense than that of negation which, moreover, as we saw, has</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">its positive effect in the negatum: a non-being which is itself again a being. &lt;The modification</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">does not cancel out, does not &quot;effect'' anything: it is the conscious counterpart of all producing: its </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">neutralization.^</span><span class="font17"> It is included in every abstaining-from-producing something, putting-something-out-of-action, &quot;parenthesizing-&quot; it, &quot;leaving-something-undecided'' and then having-an-&quot;undecided''-something, being-&quot;immersed''-in-the</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17">producing, or &quot;merely con-ceiving<sup>55</sup> the something produced without &quot;doing anything with it. <sup>5521</sup> .</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Since this modification has never been scientifically elaborated, and, therefore, also not fixed terminologically (where it had been touched upon it had been confused with other modifications), and since even a univocal name is lacking for it in ordinary language, we can only approach it circumscriptively and successively by a process of elimination. For all the expressions just collected together as a preliminary indication contain a surplus of sense. They all connote a voluntary doing, whereas that should not matter at all. We therefore eliminate it. In any case, the result of this doing has a content peculiar to it which, by disregarding the fact that it &quot;originates&quot; in the doing (which </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">too,</span><span class="font17"> naturally, would be a phenomenological Datum), can be considered in itself apart from such voluntary doing as it is possible and present in the concatenation of mental processes. If we thus exclude the letting-it-be-undecided pertaining to everything voluntary, but also not understanding it in the sense of some-</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">223</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">thing dubitable or hypothetical, then there remains a certain having-an-&quot;undecided'' something or, better still, a certain having-something-^standing there<sup>55</sup> which is not &quot;actually&quot; intended to as standing there. The posited characteristic has become powerless. Believing is now no longer serious believing, deeming likely is no longer serious deeming likely, negating is no longer serious negating, etc. It is a </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">^neutralized<sup>33</sup></span><span class="font17"> believing, deeming likely, negating, or the like, the correlates of which repeat those of the unmodified mental processes but in a radically modified way: the being simpliciter, the being possible, the being probable, likewise the non-being and each of the other negata and affirmata — all that is consciously there although not in the manner of something &quot;actually&quot; thought of but instead as something &quot;merely thought o£'' as &quot;mere thought.” Everything has the modifying &quot;parentheses,” closely akin to<sup>22</sup> to that of</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">which we have spoken so much before, and which is so important for preparing the way to phenomenology. Positings simpliciter, the nonneutralized positings, have as resultant correlates ''posita<sup>55</sup> which are characterized altogether as &quot;what exists.<sup>5,</sup> Possibility, probability, questionability, non-being and yes-being [ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Jasein]</span><span class="font17">——all that is itself something &quot;existing:&quot; namely, characterized in the correlate as existing, as ''intended to&quot; in consciousness. Neutralized positings are essentially differentiated, however, by the fact that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">their correlates do not contain anythingpositable, anything actually predicable;</span><span class="font17"> in no respect does neutralized consciousness play the role of a &quot;believing&quot; for what is intended to.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§110 . Neutralized Consciousness and Legitimation of Reason. Assuming.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">That an incomparable peculiarity of consciousness is really present here is shown by the fact that, in accordance with their essence, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">genuinely</span><span class="font17"> non-neutralized noeses are subject to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>i(</sup>legitimation of reason^</span><span class="font17"> whereas </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the question about reason and unreason makes no sensefor the neutralized noeses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The situation is the same, correlatively, for the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noemas.</span><span class="font17"> Everything characterized noematically as existing (certainly), as possible, deemed likely, questionable, null, etc., can thus be characterized in a &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;invalid&quot; way</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> it can be &quot;in truth,&quot; be possible, be null, etc. Whereas </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mere thinking-of<sup>cc</sup>posits'<sup>3</sup> nothing, it is not a positing consciousness.</span><span class="font17"> The &quot;mere thought of<sup>5</sup> actualities, possibilities, etc., </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^claims&quot;<sup>3 </sup>nothing;</span><span class="font17"> it is neither to be admitted as correct nor rejected as incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Doubtless any merely thinking-of can be converted into an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">assum-</span><span class="font17"> &lt;224&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ing<sub>3</sub></span><span class="font17"> a supposing, and this new modification (in the same way as that of merely thinking-of) is subject to unconditioned free will. In its turn, however, supposing is thus something like positing; the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">supposed, </span><span class="font17">in its turn, is a kind of</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>C(</sup>positum/<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font17"> except that it is a modification of doxic positing entirely of its own sort standing over against and apart from the principal series dealt with above.

It is a fundamental error to confuse the one with the other and</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">to overlook the equivocations contained in the locutions: merely thinking-of or mere thought-of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In addition there is, likewise, a deceptive equivocation contained in the word thinking in so far as it is at one time related to the distinctive sphere of explicating, conceiving and expressing thinking, to logical thinking in a specific sense; and, at another time, it is related to the positional as positional which, precisely as we have it in view here, does not ask about any explicating and conceiving predicating.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">But a still more dangerous equivocation of the expression, ''merely thinking of,&quot; comes into question; that is to say, a very likely confusion must be guarded against, namely the confusion of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutrality modification</span><span class="font17"> with </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phantasy.</span><span class="font17"> The deceptive and not really easily untangled circumstance here consists of the facts that phantasy itself is in fact a neutrality modification, that it is of universal significance in spite of the peculiarity of its type, applicable to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> mental processes, that it also plays its role in most of the formations pertaining to thinking-of and must, nonetheless, be distinguished in that connection from the universal neutrality modification with its manifold formations corresponding to all kinds of position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">More precisely stated: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universMy phantasying</span><span class="font17"> is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutrality modification</span><span class="font17"> of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;positing&quot; presentiation,</span><span class="font17"> therefore of memory in the widest conceivable sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">225</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">It must be noted here that in ordinary language </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">presentiation </span><span class="font17">(reproduction) and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phantasy</span><span class="font17"> overlap. We use the expressions such that, taking account of our analyses, we leave the universal term presentiation without the indication of whether the relevant &quot;position&quot; is properly so-called or neutralized. For universally presentiations are divided into two groups: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">memories</span><span class="font17"> of every kind and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">their neutrality modifications.</span><span class="font17"> Nevertheless, it will be shown in what follows that this division cannot be accepted as a genuine classification.<sup>23</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the other hand, any mental process whatever (so to speak, any actually living &lt;mental process&gt;) is a mental process &quot;presently existing/<sup>5</sup> Belonging to its essence is the possibility of reflection on the same &lt;essence&gt; in which it is necessarily characterized as certainly and presently </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">existing.</span><span class="font17"> Accordingly, there corresponds to every mental process, as to every originarily individual being of which there is consciousness, a series of ideally possible memorial modifications. To </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mental living,</span><span class="font17"> as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originary consciousness of the mental process,</span><span class="font17"> there correspond, as possible parallels, the memories ofit; in addition, therefore, as neutrality modifications &lt;of memories&gt; there correspond </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phantasies. </span><span class="font17">So it is for every mental process, no matter how it might be attended to in the pure Ego's direction of regard. The following will serve by way of elucidation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Whenever any objects whatever are presentiated — let us assume for the moment that it is a mere world of phantasy, and that we are attentively adverted to it — it then belongs to the essence of phantasying consciousness that not only this world, but also at the same time the perceiving &quot;presentive of<sup>5</sup> it, is phantasied. We are adverted to it, to the &quot;perceiving in phantasy&quot; (i.e., the neutrality modification of memory), but only when, as we said before, we &quot;reflect in phantasy/<sup>5</sup> It is, however, of fundamental significance not to confuse </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font17"> modification, ideally possible at all times, which would convert any mental process, even the phantasying process itself, into the precisely corresponding </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mere phantasy,</span><span class="font17"> or, which is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">same,</span><span class="font17"> into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutralized memory<sub>y</sub></span><span class="font17"> with that neutrality modification which we can set over against each </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;positing&quot;</span><span class="font17"> mental process. In this respect memory is a wholly specific positing mental process. Another is normal perception, yet another is the perceptive or reproductive consciousness</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">226</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">of possibility, probability, questionability, the consciousness of doubt, of negation, affirmation, supposition, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We can persuade ourselves by an example that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutrality modification of normal perception^</span><span class="font17"> positing in unmodified certainty, is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutral picture-Object-consciousness</span><span class="font17"> which we find as component in normally considering the perceptually presentive depictured world. Let us try to make that clear to ourselves: Let us suppose that we are considering Durer<sup>5</sup>s engraving, &quot;Knight, Death and the Devil.&quot; In the first place, let us distinguish the normal perceiving, the correlate of which is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">physical thing, ^engravedprints</span><span class="font17"> this print in the portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the second place, wc distinguish the perceptive consciousness in which, within the black, colorless lines, there appear to us the figures</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">of the &quot;knight on his horse J &quot;death,&quot; and the &quot;devil.&quot; We do not advert to these in aesthetic contemplation as Objects; we rather advert to the realities presented &quot;in the picture&quot; — more precisely stated, to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>&lt;(</sup>depictured<sup>y,</sup></span><span class="font17"> realities, to the flesh and blood knight, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The consciousness of the &quot;picture&quot; (the small, grey figures in which, by virtue of founded noeses something else is &quot;depictively presented&quot; by similarity) which mediates and makes possible the depicturing, is now an example for the neutrality modification of perception. This </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">depicturing picture-Object</span><span class="font17"> is present to us </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neither as existing nor as not existing,</span><span class="font17"> nor in any other </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positional modality;</span><span class="font17"> or, rather, there is consciousness of it as existing, but as quasi-existing in the neutrality modification ofbeing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Likewise the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">depictured</span><span class="font17"> too, when we comport ourselves </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely aesthetically</span><span class="font17"> and take the same thing again as a &quot;mere picture&quot; without imparting to it the stamp of being or non-being, of being possible or being deemed likely, or the like. But this does not signify, as is apparent, any privation, but instead a modification— precisely that of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutralization.</span><span class="font17"> Except that we must not objectivate it as a transforming operation attached to a previous position. It can also be this on occasion. But it need not be.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§11 2. Reiterability of the Phantasy Modification. Non-reiterability of the Neutrality Modification.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">The radical difference between phantasy in the sense of neutralizing </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">227</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">presentiation and neutralizing modification taken universally is shown —to emphasize still more sharply this decisive point ofdiflerence — by the fact that, as presentiation, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phantasy modification</span><span class="font17"> is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reiterable </span><span class="font17">(there are phantasies at no matter what levels: phantasies &quot;in&quot; phantasies), while </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reiteration of the &quot;operation&quot;</span><span class="font7">妙 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutralization</span><span class="font11">，</span><span class="font17">s, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">by virtue cf its essence, excluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Our assertion ofthe possibility of reiterating reproductive (as well as depictive) modifications seems to meet with rather general opposition. This will only be changed when there will be more extensive practice in genuine phenomenological analysis than heretofore has been the case. As long as one deals with mental processes as &quot;con</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> tents&quot; or as psychial <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>elements^^ which are still regarded as bits of things despite all the fashionable arguments against atomizing and physicalizing psychology, as long as one can believe that he has</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">found, accordingly, the distinction between <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>sensation-contents^<sup>, </sup>and corresponding <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>phantasy-contents^<sup>,</sup> only in the material traits of &quot;intensity,” &quot;fullness,” or the like, there can be no improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One must first learn to see that at issue here is a difference pertaining to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">consciousness,</span><span class="font17"> that therefore the phantasma is not a mere, pale sensation-Datum but instead, in accord with its essence, phantasy </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font17"> the corresponding sensation-Datum; furthermore, one must learn to see that this &quot;oP‘ cannot enter in by any rarefaction, no matter how refined, of intensity, of content-fullness, etc., pertaining to the sensation-Datum in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">He who is practiced in consciousness-reflections (and has previously learned to see any data of intentionality of whatever sort) will </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">see</span><span class="font17"> precisely without any further difficulty the levels of consciousness which present themselves with phantasies in phantasies or with memories in memories or in phantasies. One will then see too what is inherent in the essential sort of this hierarchical formation: namely that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">every phantasy of a higher level</span><span class="font17"> can be freely converted into a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">direct phantasy</span><span class="font17"> of what was indirectly phantasied in it, whereas this free possibility does </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font17"> take place in going over from </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phantasy to the corresponding perception.</span><span class="font17"> For spontaneity there is an abyss here which the pure Ego can transcend only in the essentially new form of actualizing action and creation (where account must also be taken of hallucinating).<sup>24</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">228</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§113. Actual and Potential Positings.<sup>2b</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Our considerations of the neutrality modification and position necessitate important supplementations. We have employed the term &quot;positing&quot; consciousness in a wide sense which necessarily requires a differentiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We distinguish<sup>26</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actual</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">potential positing,</span><span class="font17"> and we employ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^position consciousness&quot;<sup>y</sup></span><span class="font17"> as the universal heading which otherwise we cannot do without.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The difference between actuality and potentiality pertaining to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positing</span><span class="font17"> is closely related to the previously discussed<sup>27</sup> difference in actuality between attention and inattention. However, by no means do they coincide. By taking notice of the neutrality modification, a duality is introduced in the universal difference between the actuality and non-actuality of the attentional turning of the Ego's regard, or an ambiguity is introduced in the concept expressed by the term actuality, the essence of which we must clarify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The neutrality modification appears to us in the contrast </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of actual<sup>23 </sup></span><span class="font17">believing, deeming likely, etc., with the peculiar modified consciousness of &quot;clearly phantasied possible&quot; believing, deeming likely, etc.; stated correlatively, in the contrast between having what exists, what probably exists, etc., </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;'really^</span><span class="font17"> before one or ''actually posited/<sup>5</sup> and having it in the manner of a &quot;merely undecided something/<sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font17">actually posited. But at the outset we also indicated the essentially different proceeding of a non-neutral and a neutral consciousness with respect to the potentiality of positions. On the basis of any </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">229</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">&quot;actual&quot; consciousness various positings potentially included may be</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">derived, and these are then </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actual</span><span class="font17"> positings: in everything actually doxically intended to there are actual predicables. But in itself a neutral consciousness does not <sup>tt</sup>contain^^ any sort of &quot;actual&quot; predicables. The explication by attentional actualities, by advertence to the different predicates of the objective something intended to, yields nothing but neutral acts or nothing but modified predicates. This disparate potentiality in neutral and non-neutral consciousness, this remarkable fact that the universal potentiality pertaining to attentional advertences is thus bifurcated, now requires a profbunder investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The considerations of the last paragraph but one reveal that every actual mental process, as existing in the present — or, as we can also say, as the temporal unity constitued in phenomenological consciousness of time — carries with itself in a certain way, its own characteristic of being </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">way similar to something perceived,</span><span class="font17"> To every present of the actual<sup>29</sup> mental process there corresponds idealiter a neutrality modification, namely a possible present of the phantasyprocess which precisely corresponds to it in content.<sup>30</sup> Each such phantasy-process is not present as actually existing, but rather is characterized as &quot;quasi&quot; present. It is in fact quite similar to the comparison of noematic givennesses of any perception whatever with those of phantasying (contemplation in phantasy) precisely corresponding to it idealiter: Everything perceived is characterized as ''actually present being,&quot; everything phantasied in parallel as the same in content but as &quot;mere phantasy,<sup>5,</sup> as &quot;quasi&quot; present being. Thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Consciousness of time originaliter itself functions as<sup>31</sup> perceptual consciousness</span><span class="font17"> and has its counterpart in a corresponding phantasyconsciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, this all-embracing consciousness of time is obviously </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font7">。</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">continual perceiving of something immanent in the pregnant</span><span class="font17"> sense, i.e., in the sense of an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actually positing</span><span class="font17"> perceiving which is, indeed, a mental process in our sense: a mental process inherent in immanental time, enduring in the present, constituted in the consciousness of time. In °ther words, it is without question not a continual inner reflection in which mental processes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">posited</span><span class="font17"> in the specific sense, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">seized upon as </span><span class="font17">actually </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">existing,</span><span class="font17"> would become objective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Among the mental processes there are distinctive ones called reflections on something immanent, especially perceptions of some-&lt;230&gt; thing immanent which are directed to their objects in actually seizing upon and positing being. In addition, among the same mental processes there are also those perceptions, positing being in the same sense, which are directed to something transcendent, the so-called perceptions of something external. In the normal sense of the word, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;perception”</span><span class="font17"> not only signifies universally that some physical thing or other </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">appears<sup>c(</sup>personally^present</span><span class="font17"> to the Ego, but that the Ego </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">attentively perceives</span><span class="font17"> the appearing physical thing, seizing upon, positing it as actually existing. The actuality of positing factual existence is, according to what was elaborated before, neutralized in perceptual picture-consciousness.<sup>32</sup> Adverted to the &quot;picture&quot; (not to the depictured), we do not seize upon anything actual as object, but instead precisely a picture, a fictum. <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>Seizing-upon<sup>?,</sup> has the actuality pertaining to advertence, but it is not &quot;actual&quot; seizing-upon; it is rather mere seizing-upon in the modification </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of<sup>t(</sup>quasi^</span><span class="font17"> the positing is not actual<sup>33</sup> positing but instead modified into &quot;quasi</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17">&lt;positing&gt;.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">By turning the mental regard away from the fictum, the at-tentional actuality pertaining to the neutralized position passes over into potentiality: the picture still appears but is not &quot;heeded J it is not ——in the mode of &quot;quasi” ——seized upon. Included in the essence of this situation and its potentiality are possibilities for actual advertences which here, however, never allow actualities of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">position</span><span class="font17"> to emerge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Something similar occurs when we compare &quot;actional&quot; (not neutral, actually positing<sup>34</sup>) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">rememberings</span><span class="font17"> with those in which the remembered still appears, to be sure, but is no longer actually posited by turning away the regard. The potentiality of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">position</span><span class="font17"> of what &quot;still&quot; appears signifies here that, by virtue of attentional actuality, there emerge not just any seizing-upon cogitationes whatever, but precisely those which <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>actually^^ seize upon, which actually posit. In the neutrality modifications of rememberings, i.e., mere </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phantasies, </span><span class="font17">we have attentional potentialities the transmutation of which into actualities yield, to be sure, &quot;acts&quot; (cogitationes), but entirely neu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">tralized, doxic positions entirely in the mode of quasi.<sup>35</sup> What is phantasied is intended to not as &quot;actually&quot; present, past, or future; rather it only &quot;hovers&quot; before us as what is without actuality of position.<sup>36</sup> Mere advertence of the regard cannot set aside this neutrality, no more than it can generate posited actuality<sup>37</sup> in other cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Every perception has — and this can still serve us by way of further illustration — its background of perception. The specific physical thing seized upon has its perceptively co-appearing physical </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">surroundings,</span><span class="font17"> lacking particular positing of factual existence. It is also an </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">231</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">&quot;actually existing&quot; surroundings, intended to in such a manner that —in the sense of an eidetic possibility — an actual, existence-positing regard </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font17"> be directed to it. It is, to a certain extent, a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unity of potential positions.</span><span class="font17"> The situation is similar in the case of memory and its memorial background; or also in the case of perception or of memory with respect to their halo of retentions and protentions, retrospective memory and anticipations which press forward in greater or lesser fullness and change in their degrees of clarity, but are not effected in the form of actual positings. In all these cases the actualization of ''potential positions&quot; necessarily leads, by corresponding advertences of regard (attentional actuality), to always new actual positions, and this belongs to the essence of this situation. But if we pass over to the parallel neutrality modifications, then everything is translated into the modification of the quasi, even the &quot;potentiality&quot; itself The picture-Object and the phantasy-Object also (and necessarily) have attentional backgrounds. '<sup>t</sup>Background<sup>,5</sup> is, again, the name for potential advertences and &quot;seizings-upon.&quot; However, the effecting of actual advertence does not, of essential necessity, lead here to actual positions but always only to modified ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Of particular interest to us here is the fact that the same thing happens with the modal variations of the specific doxic positing (doxic primal positing), with deeming likely, deeming possible, questioning, etc., as well as with denying and affirming. The correlates intended to in them, possibility, probability, non-being, and the like, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font17"> undergo doxic positing and therefore at the same time specific <sup>&lt;t</sup>objectivation.^^ But while we &quot;live in&quot; the deeming likely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">questioning, rejecting, affirming, or the like, we do not effect any doxic primal positing — although other </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^positings^</span><span class="font17"> in the sense of a necessary universalization of the concept, &lt;are effected</span><span class="font7">〉一 </span><span class="font17">that is to say: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positings pertaining to deeming likely, to questionability, to denying,</span><span class="font17"> etc. But we </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font17"> at any time effect the corresponding doxic primal positings; grounded in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of the phenomenological situations is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ideal possibility of actualizing the potential positings</span><span class="font17"> included in them.<sup>38 </sup>This actualization leads now, if actual positings were involved at the outset, always again to actual positings as potentially included in the &lt;232&gt; positings which are the starting point. If we translate the positings which are the starting point into the language of neutrality, the potentiality is also translated into &lt;the language of neutrality.&gt; If we effect deemings likely, questionings, or the like, in mere phantasy, then everything developed before indeed subsists, but now with changed signs. All of the doxic positings and modalities of being, derived from the original acts or act-noemas by possible attentional turning of the regard, are now neutralized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§11 4. Further Concerning the Potentiality of Positing and</span><span class="font7"> 仇</span><span class="font17">e </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Neutrality Modification.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">The difference between non-neutral and neutral consciousness concerns, according to the analyses carried out, not only processes of consciousness in the attentional mode of the cogito, but also in the mode of attentional non-actuality. &lt;The distinction</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">is manifested in the double comportment of the &quot;backgrounds&quot; of consciousness in their attentional transmutation into &quot;fbregrounds;&quot; more precisely stated, in their transmutation into attentional actualities with which the original mental process is converted into a doxic cogito, indeed, into protodoxa. This<sup>39</sup> is without question possible under all circumstances; for belonging to the essence of every intentive mental process is the possibility of &quot;looking at&quot; its noeses as well as its noemas, at the noematically constituted objectivities and their predicates — of seizing upon and positing them in the mode of protodoxa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As we can also say, the situation is that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutrality modification is not</span><span class="font7">。</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">specific modification</span><span class="font17"> attached to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actional</span><span class="font17"> positings, which are the only ones which are actual; it is, instead, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">an eidetically fundamental peculiarity concerning any consciousness whatever,</span><span class="font17"> expressed in the attitude toward actual protodoxic positableness or non-positableness. Whence the necessity to exhibit them just in the actual primal positings or in the modification which they undergo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Determined in greater detail, it is a question of the following: Of whatever kind and form it may be, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">taken universally, consciousness is traversed by</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">radical separation:</span><span class="font17"> in the first place, as we know, there belongs to every consciousness in which the pure Ego does not live from the outset as an &quot;effecting'' Ego, which therefore does not have the form &quot;cogito&quot; from the outset, the essentially possible modification of being converted into this form. There now exist </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font17"> fundamental possibilities for the mode of the effecting of consciousness within the mode of cogito;<sup>40</sup> or expressed in another way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">To every cogito there belongs a counterpart which precisely corresponds to it</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">233</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">such that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its noema has</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17">s </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">precisely corresponding counter-noema</span><span class="font17"> in the parallel cogito.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The relationship of the parallel &quot;acts&quot; consists of the fact that one of the two is an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;actual</span><span class="font17"> act,<sup>,s</sup> the cogito an &quot;actual&quot; &lt;cogito,&gt; an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;actually</span><span class="font17"> positing&quot; cogito, while the other is a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;shadowing&quot;</span><span class="font17"> of an act, an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">improper,</span><span class="font17"> not &quot;actually positing&quot; cogito. The one act actually produces, the other is a mere reflection of a production.<sup>41</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To this there corresponds the radical difference </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">oicorrelates:</span><span class="font17"> on the one side, there is the constituted noematic production which has the characteristic of the unmodified, actual production; on the other side, there is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^mere thought qf'</span><span class="font17"> the precisely corresponding production. The actual and modified &lt;productions&gt; correspond to each other idealiter with absolute precision and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">yet they are not &quot;&nbsp;the same essence.</span><span class="font17"> For the modification is carried over to the essence: to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originary</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> there corresponds its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">counter-essence</span><span class="font17"> as a &quot;shadow&quot; of the same essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Of course, in the metaphorical language of shadows, reflection, picture, one should not insinuate anything of mere illusion, of deceptive opinion, or the like, by which indeed actual acts or positional correlates would be given. It is not necessary to warn anew against the so obvious confusion of the modification at issue here with the phantasy modification which likewise creates a counterpart, its phantasy image, for every mental process — as the present of the mental process in the consciousness of internal time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The radical separation of intentional mental processes into two classes which stand to each other as actuality and powerless reflection of noematic producing, is made manifest to us here (when we start out from the doxic domain) by the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">follov/ingjundamental</span><span class="font17"> propositions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Every </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">cogito</span><span class="font17"> is<sup>42</sup> in itself either a doxic primal positing or it is not. But by virtue of a lawfulness once more belonging to the generically fundamental essence of any consciousness whatever, any cogito can become converted into a doxic primal positing. &lt;That occurs,&gt; however, in many different ways, and especially in such a way that every </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>iQ</sup>posited characteristic^</span><span class="font17"> in the widest sense, constituted in the noema of this cogito as correlate of noetic &quot;positing&quot; (in a correspondingly widest sense) belonging to the cogito, undergoes transmutation into a being-characteristic and accordingly takes on the form of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">modality of being in the widest of all senses.</span><span class="font17"> In this way the characteristic of &quot;pro-bable,^^ which is the noematic correlate of deeming likely and, to be </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">234</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">sure, specifically of the &quot;act-characteristic&quot; of the &quot;postiting&quot; of deeming likely as deeming likely, is converted into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being</span><span class="font17"> probable; similarly, the noematic characteristic of <sup>t&lt;</sup>questionable,^^ this specific correlate of positing of questionability, is converted into the form of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being</span><span class="font17"> questionable; the negation-correlate is converted into the form </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of non-being:</span><span class="font17"> pure forms which, so to speak, have taken on the stamp of the actual doxic primal positing. But this extends still further. We will find grounds for extending the concept of positing to all act-spheres and thus speak o</span><span class="font7">「</span><span class="font17">e.g., liking——positing, wishing-positing, willing-positing, with their noematic correlates &quot;likes,&quot; &quot;wished fbr,&quot; &quot;ought to be in the practical realm,<sup>5,</sup> and the like. These correlates also take on the form of being-modalities in an extremely extended sense by the a priori possible conversion of the acts in</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">question into a doxically primal positing: Thus the &quot;liked,&quot; the &quot;wished f^r,^^ the &quot;ought,&quot; etc., become predicable; for in the actual, primal belief-positing it is intended to as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being</span><span class="font17"> pleasant, as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being </span><span class="font17">wished for, etc.<sup>43</sup> But the conversion — in these examples — is to be understood in such a way that it preserves the noema of the original mental process with regard to its whole essence except for the mode of givenness which changes with the conversion in conformity to laws. Nevertheless, this point still requires supplementation.<sup>44</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The cases are now radically separated by the fact that the protodoxa in question is either an actual protodoxa, so to speak, an actually believed belief or, however, its powerless counterpart, the mere &quot;thinking of&quot; (being simpliciter, being possible, etc.). What results from that doxic transmutation of the particular mental process, be it the unfolding of its noematic components into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actual </span><span class="font17">doxically primal positions, or be it exclusively into protodoxic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutralities,</span><span class="font17"> is predetermined with absolute firmness by the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of the intentive mental process in question. From the outset, therefore a firm set of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">potential being-positions</span><span class="font17"> is predesignated in the essence of every mental process of consciousness and, more particularly, depending on how the respective consciousness is characterized from the beginning, a field of possible actual positions or possible neutral &quot;shadow positions^^ &lt;is predesignated&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And, again: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universally consciousness</span><span class="font17"> is of such a character that it is of a double type: prototype and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">shadowpositional</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutral</span><span class="font17"> consciousness. The one is characterized by the fact of its doxic potentiality leading to actual positing doxic acts; the other by being only a shadow-image of such acts, by only allowing a neutrality modification to emerge from them; in other words, &lt;it is characterized by the fact&gt; that nothing doxically graspable is contained in its noematic composition or, which again is equivalent, that it does not contain an &quot;actual&quot; noema but instead only a counter-image of an</span><span class="font7">〈&quot;</span><span class="font17">actual&quot; noema&gt;.<sup>45</sup>Merely </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> doxic positedness only remains to the neutral</span></p>

In the latter cases it contains, in other words, in its noematic composition nothing at all which is doxically seizable or, equivalently stated, it contains nothing &quot;actually” noematic of any kind but only &quot;counter-images” of noemas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">mental processes: that belonging to them as consciousness of Data in immanental time, determining them precisely as modified consciousness of a modified noema.<sup>46</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">From now on the expressions </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;positional</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;neutral&quot;</span><span class="font17"> should serve us terminologically. Every mental process, whether it has the form of cogito or whether it is or is not an act in some other particular sense, falls under this opposition. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Positionality</span><span class="font17"> therefore does not signify the presence or the effecting of an actual position; it only expresses a certain potentiality for the effecting of actional positing doxic acts. Let us nevertheless include in the concept of positing mental processes the case where a mental process is from the outset a position which has been effected — an inclusion which is less objectionable because, according to eidetic law, to every position effected there belongs a plurality of potential positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The distinction between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positionality</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">neutrality</span><span class="font17"> does not express, as has been confirmed, any mere, peculiar ownness related to belief-positings, any mere sort of belief-modification such as deeming likely, questioning, or the like, or, in another direction, assumings, negat-ings, affirmings — therefore not variations of a primal mode, of believing in the pregnant sense. As we had foretold, it is in fact a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universal difference pertaining to consciousness</span><span class="font17"> but which, for good reasons, in the course of our analysis appears connected with the distinction specifically demonstrated in the narrow sphere of the doxic cogito between position (i.e., actual) believing and its neutral counterpart (the merely <sup>&lt;€</sup>thinking-off<sup>5</sup>). There emerge really remarkable and profound eidetic combinations among act-characteristics of believing and all other kinds of act-characteristics, and thus all kinds of consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">It is still important to take account of some earlier observations.<sup>47 </sup></span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">236</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">Taken universally, the cogito is explicit<sup>48</sup> intentionality. The concept of any intentive mental process whatever already presupposes the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">oppostition of potentiality and actuality and, more particularly, in the universal signification of these terms in so far as we now, in the transition to the explicit<sup>49</sup> cogito and in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reflection</span><span class="font17"> on the mental process not made explicit<sup>50</sup> along with its noetic-noematic components, are able to recognize that it includes in itself intentionalities or noemas which are peculiar to it. Thus, e.g., with regard to consciousness of the unobserved, but subsequently observed, background in the case of perception, memory, etc. The explicit<sup>51</sup> intentive mental process is an &quot;I think'' which is &quot;effected.'' But the same &quot;I think'' can be converted into a <sup>cc</sup>non-effected<sup>55</sup> one by way of intentional changes. The mental process pertaining to an effected perceiving, to an effected judging, feeling, willing, does not disappear when attention adverts &quot;exclusively&quot; to something new; this implies that the Ego &quot;lives&quot; exclusively in a new cogito. The earlier cogito ''fades away,&quot; sinks into &quot;darkness&quot;, but nonetheless always has an existence pertaining to the mental process, even if modified. Similarly, cogitationes break forth into the background of the mental process, sometimes modified memorially, sometimes neutrally, even sometimes unmodified. E.g., a belief, an actual belief is &quot;aroused;&quot; we already believe &quot;befbre we know it.'' Similarly, under circumstances positing of likings or dislikings, desirings, even resolves, are already alive before we &quot;live&quot; in them, before we effect the cogito proper, before the Ego is <sup>^^</sup>activated^^ judgingly, likingly, desiringly, willingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus the cogito designates in fact (and so we had introduced the concept previously) the act </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">proper</span><span class="font17"> of perceiving, of judging, of liking,<sup>52</sup> etc. On the other hand, however, the whole structure of the mental process in the cases described, with all its positings and noematic characteristics, is the same even when this actionality of the cogito is lacking to it. It is to that extent that we separate more dictinctly </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">effected acts</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">non-effected acts;<sup>53</sup></span><span class="font17"> the latter are either acts which &quot;have fallen out of effectuation/<sup>5</sup> or they are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">act-arousals.</span><span class="font17"> The latter term can just as well be employed universally for any non-</span></p>

The effected acts, or as stated better in a certain respect (namely, with respect to the fact that it concerns processes), the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">act-effectings</span><span class="font17"> make up the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;position-takings&quot; in the widest </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">237</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sense,</span><span class="font17"> whereas the use of the term &quot;position-taking'' in the pregnant</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">It is now clear that acts in the widest sense,<sup>56</sup> precisely as in the case of specific cogitationes, bear within themselves the distinction between positionality and neutrality, that they are productive noemat-ically and positionally prior to the transmutation into cogitationes, except that we only first catch sight of these productions by acts in the narrower sense, by cogitationes. The positings, or the positings in the mode of<sup>&lt;^</sup>quasi,^^ are already actually present in them with the whole noeses to which these positings belong: the ideal case being presupposed that they are not also intentively enriched and otherwise altered at the same time &lt;that the noeses are&gt; transmuted.

<p><span class="font17">In the further analyses this preference for doxic primal positing will undergo a limitation.

Within this universal primacy of any doxic modalities whatever, the doxic primal positing, the doxic certainty, then has, however, the quite particular primacy of these modalities themselves being transmuted into aoxic positings so that now, again, all neutrality has its index in the doxic potentiality in the distinctive sense of being related back to the primal positing. In this connection, the kind of &quot;coincidence” of anything doxic whatever with positing of any sort receives its more precise determination.<sup>60</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Now, the propositions stated in the widest universality (although with some omissions), but which can only be made with insight into specific act-spheres, immediately require a broader basis of grounding. We have not yet thoroughly examined the parallelism of noesis and noema in all realms of intentionality. Of itself this principal theme of this Part also demands the extension of analysis. However, in carrying out this extension our universal assertions about the neutrality modification will at the same time be confirmed and supplemented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§116 Transition to New Analyses, The Founded Noeses and Their Noematic Correlates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We studied before a series of universal events in the structure of noeses and noemas within a large and yet very restricted framework </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">studied them, to be sure, on a very modest scale only to the extent</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">required to make them stand out and to achieve our guiding purpose of acquiring for ourselves a universal idea, rich in content, of the groups of problems which the universal dual theme of noesis and noema carries with it. No matter how many different complications they have attracted, our studies are related to a mere lower stratum of the stream of mental processes to which intentionalities of an even relatively simpler structure always belong. We have shown a preference (aside from the last anticipatory observations) for sensuous intuitions, in particular those of appearing realities, as well as for the<sup>61</sup> sensuous </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">objectivations</span><span class="font17"> which emerge from them by being obscured and yet which, without question, are united with them by a community of essence. At the same time, &lt;sensuous objectivation&gt; designates the genus. As a result, we also draw into consideration, more particularly, all phenomena essentially belonging to it, thus reflective intuitions and objectivations taken universally, the objects </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">239</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">of which are no longer things pertaining to the senses.<sup>62</sup> The universal acceptance of our results, given the way in which we have conducted the investigation, and suggesting the feeling that whatever is attached to the lower domain is incidental, is forced upon us as soon as we extend the framework of our research. We then see that all the differences between the central core of sense (which certainly needs further analysis), and the posited characteristics grouped about it, return and likewise all the modifications which — like those of presentiation, attention, neutralization — affect the core of sense in its own peculiar ways, nonetheless leaving its ''something identical.<sup>5,</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We can now follow </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font17"> different directions, both of which lead to intentionalities founded on objectivations: we can either go in the direction toward noetic syntheses, or in that which leads up to new sorts of,<sup>63</sup> but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">founded,</span><span class="font17"> species </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ofpositing.^</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we take the latter direction, then we encounter the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noeses of feeling, of desiring, of willing</span><span class="font17"> (first of all, the simplest ones possible, i.e., free of syntheses at lower or higher levels), which are founded on &quot;objectivations,” on perceptions, on memories, on sign-objectivations etc., and which, in their structure, show obvious</span></p>

For all such questions we refer to prospective publications. The present investigation briefly indicates the findings derived from the theoretical content of those future publications.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">触</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Co</span><span class="font12">勿</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> new sorts of </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">changed to</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> new</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">differences in level-by-level founding. We now give preference everywhere, as concerns the total acts, to the positional forms (which ought not, however, exclude neutral lower levels) because what is to be said of them carries over, appropriately modified, to the corresponding neutralizations. For example, an aesthetic liking may be founded on a neutrality-consciousness with a perceptual or reproductive content; a gladness or a sorrow on a (non-neutralized) belief or belief-modality; a striving for or against on the same, but related to something valued as agreeable, or beautiful, etc.<sup>64</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Before going into the species of this structure, what interests us here is that with the new noetic moments </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">new noematic moments</span><span class="font17"> also make their appearance in the correlates. On the one hand, there are new characteristics which are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">analogous to the modes of belief but</span><span class="font17"> possess, at the same time, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">themselves</span><span class="font17"> doxo-logical<sup>65</sup> positiableness in their new content; on the other hand, connected with the novel moments there are also novel </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">''apprehensions^</span><span class="font17"> and a new sense becomes constituted which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">founded on,</span><span class="font17"> while at the same time embracing, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the noesis underlying it.</span><span class="font17"> The new sense brings in a totally </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">new dimension of sense; </span><span class="font17">with it no new determining parts of mere &quot;things&quot; are constituted, but instead </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">values of things,</span><span class="font17"> value-qualities, or concrete Objects with</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">240</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">values: beauty and ugliness, goodness and badness; the use-Object, the art work, the machine, the book, the action, the deed, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Moreover, any full mental process of the higher level also shows in its full correlate a structure similar to the one we have seen at a lower level. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">In the noema belonging to the higher level the valued as valued is possibly</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">core of sense surrounded by new posited characteristics.</span><span class="font17"> The &quot;valued,&quot; the &quot;likeable,&quot; &quot;happy,&quot; etc., function in a way similar to the &quot;possi-blej &quot;presumableJ or, again, like &quot;null,'' or &quot;indeed&quot; — although it would be absurd to put them in this series of characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With respect to these new characteristics consciousness is again, in this connection, a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positing</span><span class="font17"> consciousness: the &quot;valued&quot; can be doxi-cally posited as being valuable. Furthermore, &quot;being,&quot; which belongs to &quot;value'' as its characterization, can also be meant as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">modal-ized</span><span class="font17"> like any &quot;existing&quot; or &quot;certain:&quot; if so, consciousness is then consciousness of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">possible values;</span><span class="font17"> the &quot;thing&quot; only suggests itself as</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;possibly&gt; valuable; or else it is intended to as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">presumably valuable,</span><span class="font17"> as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">non-valuable</span><span class="font17"> (which, however, is not equivalent to saying &quot;worthless&quot; —bad, ugly or the like; cancelling out <sup>t&lt;</sup>value^^ is expressed simply by <sup>t&lt;</sup>non-valuable^^). All such modifications affect value-consciousness, the valuing noeses, not just externally but also internally, as well as the corresponding noemas (cf. p. 243).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A multiplicity of profound alterations result again in the form of attentional modifications according as, in conformity with the manifold eidetic possiblities, the attentive regard passes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">through</span><span class="font17"> the various intentive strata to the ''materially determinate affair<sup>5?</sup> and the material moments — resulting in an interrelated system of modifications which we already know as a lower level; but the regard then is also directed to the values, to the constituted determinations belonging to a higher level, by passing through the apprehensions constituting them; then &lt;the attentive regards is directed&gt; to the noemas as noemas, again, to their characteristics or, in the other reflection, to the noeses — and all of this in the specific modes of attending to, marginal observing, non-observing or the like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Extremely difficult investigations are to be carried out in order to explicate purely and make clear these complicated structures, how, eg., the ^value-apprehensions<sup>55</sup> are related to the apprehensions of materially determinate affairs, how the new noematic character-&lt;241 &gt;&nbsp;izations (good, beautiful, and so forth) are related to modalities of belief, how they systematically fit into series and species, and the same for similar questions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§117. The Founded Positings and the Conclusion of the Doctrine of Neutrality Modifications. The Universal Concept of Positing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">We shall now examine the relationship of new noetic and noematic strata of consciousness to neutralization. We relate this modification to doxic positionality. As we can easily persuade ourselves, in the strata now being made prominent, this &lt;positionality&gt; plays the role in fact which we attributed to it in advance in the widest act-spheres and which we specifically considered in the &lt;act-sphere&gt; of modalities of judgment. In the consciousness which deems likely, the &quot;likely J the &quot;probable,&quot; are positionally &quot;inherent;&quot; likewise, however, in the consciousness which likes, the &quot;pleasing&quot; is also &quot;inherent;&quot; in the consciousness which is glad, the &quot;gladsome&quot; is inherent; and so</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">forth. It is inherent in it, i.e., it is accessible to doxic positing, and on that account it is predicable. Accordingly, every emotional consciousness, along with its novel founded emotional noeses, comes under the concept of positing consciousness as we have elaborated this concept for ourselves ——with reference to doxic positionalities and ultimately to positional certainties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Seen more precisely, however, we must still say that the relating of the neutrality modification to doxic positionality, important as the insights are which it grounds, still has been taken in a certain sense in a roundabout way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us make it clear, first of all, that acts of liking (&quot;effected'' or not), likewise embtional or volitional acts, of every kind are precisely &quot;acts,&quot; &quot;intentive mental processes,&quot; and that belonging to them, in every case, is the <sup>t&lt;</sup>intentio,^^ the &quot;position</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17">taking;'' or, expressed in another way, they are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;positings&quot;<sup>9</sup></span><span class="font17"> in a widest but essentially unified sense, although not doxic positings. We said above in passing, quite correctly, that, taken universally, act-characteristics are</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>(&lt;</sup>positings'^ </span><span class="font17">—positings in the extended sense and only in the particular belief-positings or their modalities. The essential analogy of specific liking-noeses with the belief-positings is obvious, as is the case with wishing-noeses, willing-noeses, etc. Even in valuing, wishing, willing, something is &quot;posited,&quot; apart from the doxic positionality &quot;inherent&quot; in them.<sup>67</sup> That is indeed also the source of all parallelizations between the various species of consciousness and the classification of those species: one properly classifies the species of positing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To the essence of every intentive mental process, whatever may</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">242</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">otherwise be found in its concrete composition, there belongs the having of at least one, but as a rule many, <sup>tc</sup>posi ting-characteristics,<sup>5, </sup>&quot;positings,&quot; interconnected by way of the relationship of founding; there is, in this plurality, then, necessarily a positing which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">archon-tic^</span><span class="font17"> so to speak, which unifies and governs all the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The highest generic unity connecting all these specific ^act-characteristics,<sup>5,</sup> the characteristic of <sup>t&lt;</sup>positing,^^ does not exclude essential and generic differences.<sup>68</sup> Thus the emotional positings are</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">akin to the doxic positings as positings, but they by no means belong together as do all modalities of believing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Given </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eo ipso</span><span class="font17"> along with the generic community of essence belonging to all positing-characteristics is the community of essence belonging to their noematic correlates of positing (the &quot;positing characteristics in the noematic sense<sup>55</sup>); and if we take the latter with their further noematic foundations, then the community of essence belonging to all &quot;posita&quot; is eo ipso given. Ultimately grounded in this, however, are the analogies, always felt, between universal logic, universal theory of values, and ethics which, if followed to their ultimate depths, lead to the constitution of the universal </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal </span><span class="font17">parallel disciplines of formal logic, formal axiology, and theory of practice.<sup>69</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We are thus led back to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universalized</span><span class="font17"> heading of</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>i(</sup>positing^</span><span class="font17"> to which we now relate the following proposition:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Every consciousness is either an actual or potential<sup>(&lt;</sup>positing'<sup>9</sup> consciousness. </span><span class="font17">The earlier concept of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>i(</sup>actual positing</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> and along with it that of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positionality^</span><span class="font17"> undergo therefore a corresponding extension. As a consequence, our doctrine of neutralization and its relationship to positionality is carried over to the extended concept of positing. There thus pertains to any positing consciousness whatever, whether or not it is effected, the universal modification which we called the neutralizing modification and, more particularly,<sup>70</sup>rfzr^Z/y in the following way. On the one hand, we have characterized positing of positions </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[positionalen Thesen]</span><span class="font17"> by the fact that they are actual positings or are converted into actual ones; that, as a consequence, they have &quot;actual&quot; positable noemata — actually positable in the extended sense. In contrast to these, there are the improper, the &quot;quasi&quot;-positings, the ineffectual mirrorings, incapable of taking up into themselves any actual position-efTectuations with respect to their </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">243</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">noemata, not even neutralized ones. The distinction between neutrality and positionality has its noetic and noematic parallel; it directly concerns, as conceived here, all sorts of positional characteristics without taking the way around positions in the narrow and only ordinary sense of the word doxic primal positing — in which it alone can demonstrate itself</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But that signifies that the pre-eminence of this specifically doxic positing has its deepest foundation in the things themselves. Accord-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">ing to our analyses precisely the doxic modalities, and among them in a particular way, the doxic primal positing, that of belief-certainty, have the unique primacy that their positional potentiality embraces the entire sphere of consciousness. According to an eidetic law, any positing, of no matter what genus, can be transmuted into an actual doxic positing by virtue of the doxic characterizations inseparably belonging to its essence. A positional act posits, but in no matter which &quot;quality&quot; it posits, it also posits doxically; whatever is posited by it in another mode is also posited as existing: except that &lt;it is not posited&gt; actually. But actuality can be generated in conformity with its essence in the manner of an essentially possible &quot;Operation.&quot; Any &quot;positumj e.g., a wish-positum, can thereby be transmuted into a doxic positum, and it is then in a certain manner still both in one: at the same time, doxic positum and wish-positum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this connection, it is conformable to the eidetic laws that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">primacy of the doxic properly concerns the doxic modalities in a universal way. </span><span class="font17">For every emotional mental process, every valuing, every wishing, willing, is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in itself</span><span class="font17"> either characterized as being certain or as being deemed possible or else as a valuing, wishing, being willed, deemed likely, doubtful.<sup>71</sup> Thus, for example, when we are not focused on the doxic modalities value is precisely not actually posited in its doxic characteristics. Value is intended to in valuing, the pleasing in liking, the gladsome in being glad, but sometimes in such a way that we are not entirely &quot;certain&quot; in valuing; or, such that the thing is only deemed possible as valuable, as perhaps valuable, while we still do not take sides in the valuing. Living in such modifications of valuing consciousness, we need not be focused on the doxic. But we can become so focused when, perchance, we are living in the positing of deeming possible and then pass over into the corresponding belief-positing which, conceived predicatively, now receives the form: &quot;the thing should be valuable;<sup>,</sup>^ or, turning to the noetic side and to the valuing Ego: &quot;it suggests itself to me as valuable (or perhaps valuable).” The same holds for other modalities.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;244&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Doxic modalities, in this form, are inserted into all posited characteristics </span><span class="font17">and, if the mode is that of certainty, doxic primal positings </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">coincide </span><span class="font17">with the posited characteristics according to the noematic sense. But because this also holds for the doxic variations, doxic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">primalpositings</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">thus also inhere (now no longer in noematic coincidence) in every act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We can, accordingly, also say</span><span class="font11">：</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Every</span><span class="font7"> 〃以,</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">or every act-correlate<sub>y</sub> includes in itself, implicitly or explicitly, something ''logical.&quot;</span><span class="font17"> It is always to be explicated logically, namely by virtue of the essential universality with which the noetic stratum of &quot;expressing” allows of being attached to everything noetic (or that of expression to everything noematic). It is thereby evidential that with the passing over into the neutrality modification the expressing itself and its expressed as expressed are neutralized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Resulting from all that is the fact </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">that any acts whatever</span><span class="font7"> 一 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">even emotional and volitional acts — are <sup>((</sup>objectwating^ <sup>((</sup>constituting&quot;' objects originaliter</span><span class="font17"> &lt;and therefbro necessary sources of different regions of being and their respective ontologies. For example: valuing consciousness constitutes the unique &quot;axiological” objectivity in contrast to the mere world of things, a &quot;being” of a new region in so far as precisely by virtue of the essence belonging to any valuing consciousness whatever actual doxic positings are predelineated as ideal possibilities which single out objectivities of a unique content -- values — as ''intended to” in valuing consciousness. In emotional acts they are intended to as emotional; by actualization of the doxic content belonging to these acts they come into doxic and, furthermore, into logical-expressive, meantness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Every non-doxically effected act of consciousness is in this fashion potentially objectivating; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the doxic cogito alone effects actual objectivation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Included here is the profbundest of those sources on the basis of which </span><span class="font7">仇</span><span class="font17">e </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universality of the logical,</span><span class="font17"> ultimately that of the predicative judgment, is to be clarified (whereby we include the stratum of significational expressing, which has not yet been considered in detail), and on that foundation the ultimate ground of the univers-</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">245</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">ality of the supremacy of logic itself is also understood. In further consequence the possibility, indeed the necessity, is conceived of moral and material noetic or noematic and ontological disciplines essentially related to emotional and volitional intentionality. We shall take up this theme later on after we have ascertained a few supplementary cognitions.<sup>72</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§118 . Syntheses of Consciousness. Syntactical Forms?<sup>2</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">If now we turn our attention to the second of the directions indicated above,<sup>74</sup> to the forms </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of synthetical</span><span class="font17"> consciousness, then a multiplicity of modes of formations belonging to mental processes by means of intentive connections make their appearance in our horizon which, as eidetic possibilities, pertain in part to all intentive mental processes whatever, in part to the peculiarities of their particular genera. A consciousness and a consciousness are not only bound together universally, but they are combined into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> consciousness the correlate of which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> noema which, on its side, is founded on the noemas of the combined noeses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We have not aimed at, here, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unity ^consciousness of immanental time,</span><span class="font17"> although that must be remembered too as the all-embracing unity for all mental processes belonging to the stream of mental processes and, more particularly, as a unity </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of consciousness</span><span class="font17"> combining </span><span class="font11">(</span><span class="font17">onsciousness with consciousness. If we take any particular mental process, it is thus constituted as a unity spread out in phenomenological time in the continual consciousness &quot;originaliter&quot; of time. We can, in the case of a suitable reflective attitude, take heed of the modes of givenness for consciousness of the extents of mental processes belonging to segments of the duration of mental processes; and we can, accordingly, say that the whole consciousness constituting this duration-unity is continually composed of segments in which the segments of the duration of mental processes are constituted; and that therewith the noeses are not only combined but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> noesis is constituted with </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> noema (the fulfilled duration of the mental process) which is founded on the noemas of the combined noeses. What holds for a particular mental process also holds for the whole stream of menial processes. No matter how alien in essence mental processes can be with respect to one another, they are nonetheless constituted altogether as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> temporal stream, as members in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font17">phenomenological time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Nevertheless, we have excluded this primal synthesis of conscious- </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">246</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">ness originaliter of time (which is not to be thought of as an active and discrete synthesis) along with the set of problems belonging to it.

On the other hand, we do not even enter into the very important </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">continuous syntheses,</span><span class="font17"> in any case, such as those, for example, which essentially belong to all consciousness constituting spatial physicalness. Later on we shall find ample opportunity to become more precisely acquainted with these syntheses. Our interest is turned, rather, to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">many-membered syntheses^</span><span class="font17"> thus to the peculiar modes in which discretely separated acts are combined into a membered unity, into a synthetical act of a higher hierarchical order. In the case of a continuous synthesis we do not speak of an &quot;act of a higher order;<sup>,,?5</sup> rather the unity (noetic as well as well as noematic and objective) belongs to the same hierarchical order as the unified. It is easy to see, moreover, that many of the universal considerations to follow concern in the same way continuous as well as membered </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">polythetical</span><span class="font17"> - syntheses.<sup>76</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Examples of synthetical acts ofa higher level are offered to us in the volitional sphere by the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">willing relating to</span><span class="font17"> &quot;someone else's sake;'' similarly, in the realm of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">emotional acts,</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">liking with respect to,</span><span class="font17"> the being glad </span><span class="font7">&quot;加 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reference</span><span class="font17"> /o,&quot; or, as we can likewise say, &quot;fbr the sake of someone else.&quot; And thus for all similar act-occurrences in the case of different act-genera. Obviously, all </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">acts of preference</span><span class="font17"> belong here too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We will subject to closer consideration another group of syntheses, universal in a certain fashion. It comprises </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">collecting</span><span class="font17"> (taking together), </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">disjunctive</span><span class="font17"> (concerning the &quot;this or that&quot;), </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">explicating, relating </span><span class="font17">syntheses; taken universally, &lt;the group comprises&gt; the whole series of syntheses which, according to the pure forms of the synthetical objectivities being constituted in them, determine the formal-ontological forms, and, on the other side, with respect to the structure </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">247</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">of the noematic formation are mirrored in the apophantic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">signijica-tiona! forms belonging to formal logic</span><span class="font17"> (the exclusively noematically directed logic of propositions).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The relation to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal</span><span class="font17"> ontology and logic already indicates that it is a matter there of an essentially determined closed group of syntheses which acquire an unconditioned universality of possible application</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§119 . The Transmutation of Polythetical into Monothetical Acts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">The following must be noted, first of all, with regard to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> species of membered syntheses, of polythetical acts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">No matter how many particular positings and syntheses may be fitted into it, each synthetically unitary consciousness possesses the total object belonging to it as a synthetically unitary consciousness. It is called a total object in contrast to the objects which intentionally pertain to the synthetical members of a lower or higher level in so far as all of them also contribute to it in the fashion of founding and are fitted into it. Each noesis delimited in its own peculiar way, even if it were a non-selfsufficient stratum, makes its contribution to the constitution of the total object; as, for example, the moment of valuing which is non-selfsufficient since it is necessarily founded on a consciousness of a mere thing, and which constitutes the objective valuestratum, that of &quot;value-quality.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">New strata of this sort are also the specific synthetical ones of the previously designated, most universal consciousness-syntheses, that is to say, all the forms which specifically stem from synthetical consciousness as synthetical, thus the forms of combination and the synthetical forms inherent in the members themselves (in so far as they are included in the syntheses).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We said that a total synthetical object is constituted in synthetical consciousness. But it is &quot;objective&quot; therein in a quite diflerent sense than what is constituted in a simple positing. Synthetical consciousness, or the pure Ego &quot;in&quot; it, is directed by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">many rays</span><span class="font17"> to something objective; the positional consciousness simpliciter is &lt;directed to something objectivo by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> ray. Thus synthetical collecting is a &quot;plural” consciousness; it is one and one and one taken together. Similarly, in a primal relating consciousness the relation is constituted in a two-fbld positing. And likewise everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To every such many-rayed (polythetical) constituting of synthet</span><span class="font2">ical objectivities which, </span><span class="font17">according to their essence can become intended to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^originalitef only</span><span class="font17"> synthetically — there belongs, <sup>accor</sup> ' ing to eidetic law, the possibility </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of converting what is intended to in many</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">rays into what is intended to simpliciter in one ray,</span><span class="font17"> the possibility </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of<sup>iC</sup>making objective&quot;</span><span class="font17"> in a ^monotheticaF<sup>5</sup> act </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the specific sense</span><span class="font17"> what is constituted synthetically in the first act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The synthetically constituted collection thus becomes objective in a distinctive sense, it becomes an object of a simple doxic positing in the relation of a simple positing back to the collection just constituted originaliter, thus in an appertinent noetic attaching of a positing to the synthesis. In other words: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The plural consciousness, in conformity with its essence, can become converted into a singular consciousness</span><span class="font17"> which draws the plurality from &lt;the plural consciousness&gt; as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> object, as something single; on its side, the plurality now can be combined with other pluralities and other objects become posited in a relationship to them; and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Structured in a way wholly analogous with the collecting consciousness, the situation is the same for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">disjunctive</span><span class="font17"> consciousness and its ontic or noematic correlates. Similarly, the synthetically-originally constituted </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">relationship</span><span class="font17"> can be drawn from the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">relating</span><span class="font17"> consciousness in a simple positing attached to it, and be made an object in a distinctive sense; and as an object in a distinctive sense it may be compared with other relationships and, taken universally, become applied as a subject of predicates.<sup>77</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But it must be made fully evident in that connection that what is presentiated simpliciter and what is synthetically unitary are really the same, and that the subsequent positing, or the extracting, rather than attributing anything to the synthetical consciousness, seizes instead upon what this presents. Also evidential is, certainly, the essentially difierent mode of givenness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">§/20. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Positionality and Neutrality in the Sphere of Syntheses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">All syntheses proper, and those are the ones we have had in view all along, are built up on positings simpliciter— taking this term in the universal sense established above where it comprises all &quot;intentions,&quot; all <sup>tt</sup>act-characteristics;<sup>,s</sup> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">syntheses themselves</span><span class="font17"> are positings, positings of a higher level.<sup>79</sup> Everything which we have ascertained about actuality and non-actuality, about neutrality and positionality, is extended, accordingly, to syntheses — which requires no explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In contrast, a more precise investigation would be needed here in order to ascertain in which different ways the positionality and neutrality of founding positings are related to founded positings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Universally, and not only for the specifically founded acts which we call syntheses, it is clear that one cannot say simply that a positing ofa position ofa higher level presupposes genuine positions posited at a lower level. Thus an actual seeing of an essence is indeed a positional act and not a neutralized act founded on some exempli-cative intuiting consciousness or other which, on its side, can very well be a neutral,<sup>80</sup> a phantasy consciousness. Something similar is true for an aesthetic liking with respect to its appearing object, for a positional depicturing consciousness with respect to the depictured image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I£ now, we observe the group of syntheses of interest to us, we immediately recognize the fact that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">every synthesis in the group is, with respect to its posited characteristic<sub>f</sub> dependent on the founding noeses;</span><span class="font17"> more</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;250&gt; precisely, that it is positional (and can only be positional) if all the lower positings together are positional, and neutral if they are not.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">For example, a collecting is an actual collecting or a collecting in the mode of &quot;quasi;&quot; it is an actual or neutralized positing. In the one case, all the acts related to the particular collection-members are actual positings, whereas in the other case they are not. The situation is the same for all other syntheses of the class mirrored in logical syntaxes. Pure neutrality can never function as positional synthesis; it must at least undergo transmutation into &quot;suppositions/<sup>5</sup> perchance into hypothetical antecedents or consequents, into hypothetically supposed nominatives as, e.g., &quot;pseudo Dionysius/<sup>581</sup> and other similar expressions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">§/2/. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Doxic Syntaxes^<sup>1</sup> in the Emotional and Volitional Spheres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we now ask how the syntheses of this group come to be expressed in the syntactical forms of predicative propositions which the logical theory of forms has developed, then the answer is at hand. They are precisely, it will be said, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doxic syntheses;</span><span class="font17"> or, as we may also say recalling the logical-grammatical syntaxes in which they are expressed, they are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doxic syntaxes.</span><span class="font17"> Belonging to the specific essence of doxic acts are syntaxes of &quot;and,&quot; or the plural forms, the syntaxes of &quot;or,'' of the relating positing of a predicate to the substratum pertaining to a subject-positing; and so forth. No one can doubt that &quot;belief' and &quot;judgment'' in the logical sense are intimately related (even if one does not immediately identify them), that belie</span><span class="font7">匚</span><span class="font17">syntheses find their &quot;expression&quot; in the forms of predicative propositions. However correct that may be, it is still to be seen that the interpretation indicated does not comprise in itself the whole truth. These syntheses of &quot;and,&quot; of &quot;or,&quot; of &quot;if,&quot; or of &quot;because&quot; and &quot;thus,&quot; in short, the syntheses which first ofall are presentive as doxic, are by no means </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">merely doiiAC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is a fundamental fact<sup>83</sup> that those syntheses also belong to the essence proper of non-doxic positings and that they do so, more particularly, in the following sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Undoubtedly there is such a thing as a collective gladness, a collective liking, a collective willing, etc. Or, as I usually express it, there is besides the doxic &quot;and&quot; (the logical <sup>tt</sup>and^^) an axiological and practical &quot;and.&quot; The same holds for the &quot;or&quot; and all the syntheses belonging here. For example: the mother who looks lovingly upon her flock of children, embraces each child singly and all together in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> act of love. The unity of the collective act of loving is not a loving and, in addition, a collective objectivating, even if it is attached to the loving as its necessary foundation. Loving, instead, is itself collective; it is, similarly, as many-rayed as the objectivating and perhaps the plural judging &quot;underlying&quot; it. We should speak of a plural loving in precisely the same sense as we speak of a plural objectivating, or judging. The syntactical forms enter into the essence of the emotional acts themselves, namely into the positional stratum specifically peculiar to them. This cannot be carried out for all syntheses; the example given suffices for an indication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But let us now recall for ourselves the eidetic affinity investigated above between doxic positings and positings taken universally. A parallel doxic positing is included in any positing whatever, in conformity to what it produces noematically, e.g., as this loveintention. Obviously, the parallelism between the spheres pertaining to the doxic positings and those pertaining to all other positings (the parallelism of the doxic &quot;and,&quot; &quot;or,&quot; etc., with the &quot;and,&quot; &quot;or,&quot; of valuing and willing) is a special case of the same eidetic affinity. For the synthetical emotional acts - - synthetical, namely, with respect to the syntactical forms explicated here ——constitute </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">synthetical emotional objectivities</span><span class="font17"> which are objectivated by the corresponding doxic acts. The Hock of children loved is, as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">love-Object,</span><span class="font17"> a collectivum; in the correlative application of what was explained above, that signifies not only a material collectivum and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in addition</span><span class="font17"> a love, but a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">love-collectivum: Just</span><span class="font17"> as, in a noetic respect, a ray of love emanating from the Ego is distributed among a bundle of rays each of which bears upon a particular object, so the many </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic love-characteristics</span><span class="font17"> are distributed among the love-collectivum as particular objects collected, and there are just as many posited characteristics which are synthetically combined into the noematic unity of a positional characteristic. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">252</span><span class="font7">〉</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">We see that all of these syntactical forms are parallel fbrms, t at is to say, that they belong as much to the emotional acts themse ves with their speciGc emotional components and emotional synt eses as</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">do also the doxic positionalities which run parallel to them and form an eidetic unity with them, which are extracted from them by the appropriate turning of one's regard to the particular substrata and superstrata. Naturally, what is true for the noetic sphere is transferee! to the noematic sphere. The axiological &quot;and'' essentially includes in itself a doxic &quot;and,&quot; every axiological syntactical form of the group considered here &lt;includes&gt; a logical &lt;syntactical fbrm&gt;: preciselyjust as every noematic correlate simpliciter includes in itself a &quot;being&quot; or another being-modality and, as its substratum, the form of &quot;something'' and the forms which otherwise pertain to it. Each time it is a matter of essentially possible turnings of one's regard and of the co-included positional and synthetical-doxic procedures for fashioning a new act on the basis of an emotional act in which we wholly live, so to speak, only emotionally, thus without actualizing the doxic potentialities — a new act in which the only potential emotional objectivity for the present is converted into an actual doxic and possibly expressly explicit &lt;objectivity&gt;. It is possible, accordingly, and not unusual in empirical life that, for example, we consider many intuitive objects, positing them doxically</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> that, accordingly, we effect a synthetical emotional act at the same time — perhaps the unity of collective liking, or the unity of a selective emotional act, ofa preferential liking, of a repudiating disliking; and all the while we do this, by no means do we go on to turn the whole phenomenon into a doxic phenomenon. But we do effect that turn when we make a statement, eg, about our liking of the many, or of the one in the many, about our preference for the one over against the others; and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It need not be emphasized how important the careful carrying out of such analyses is for cognizing the essence of axiological and practical objectivities, significations and modes of consciousness, therefore for the problems of the &quot;origin&quot; of ethical, aesthetical concepts and cognitions as well as those eidetically akin to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Because it is not our proper task here to solve phenomenological problems, but rather to work out scientifically the principal problems of phenomenology and to predelineate the directions of investigation cohering with them, we must be satisfied with having carried the matters under discussion this far.<sup>84</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font12">柿</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Marginal note to this paragraph in Copy A:</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> Deleatur</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">§/22. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Modes of Effectuation of the Articulated Syntheses. <sup>Ci</sup> Theme.&quot;^</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There belongs to positings and syntheses an important group of universal modifications, a brief indication of which we had best add here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A synthesis can be </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">effected</span><span class="font17"> step by step; it becomes, it arises in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">original production.</span><span class="font17"> This originarity ofbecoming in the stream of consciousness is a quite peculiar one. The positing and synthesis become while the pure Ego actionally takes one step and each new step; the Ego itself lives in the step and &quot;steps fbrth” with it. The positing, the positing-thereupon, positing antecedently and consequently, etc., is its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">free spontaneity and activity;</span><span class="font17"> the Ego does not live in the positings as passively dwelling in them; &lt;the positings&gt; are instead radiations from the &lt;pure Ego&gt; as from a primal source of generations. Every positing begins with a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">point</span><span class="font17"> 4 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">initiation,</span><span class="font17"> with a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positional point of origin;</span><span class="font17"> so it is with the first positing, as with every further one in the concatenation pertaining to the synthesis. This &quot;initiation” belongs precisely to the positing as positing qua distinctive mode of original actionality. It is, perchance, like the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fiat,</span><span class="font17"> like the initiating point of willing and acting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Still, one should not confuse the universal with the particular. The spontaneous resolve, the purposive, accomplishing deed is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> act among other acts; its syntheses are particular syntheses among others. But </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font17"> act of no matter what species can begin in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mode of spontaneity pertaining, so to speak, to its creative beginning</span><span class="font17"> in which the pure Ego makes its appearance as the subject of the spontaneity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This mode ofinitiating is immediately, and according to an eidetic necessity, converted into another mode. For example, perceptual </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">seizing upon, taking hold of,</span><span class="font17"> are immediately and without a break changed into the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;having in one's grip.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Yet another new modal alteration ensues when the positing is a mere step toward a synthesis, when the pure Ego effects a new step, and when now, in the all-inclusive unity of the synthetical consciousness, it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;still keeps'&quot; in grip</span><span class="font17"> what it just had in its grip: seizing upon the new thematic Object, or rather seizing upon a new member of the total theme as primary theme, but still holding on to the member previously seized upon as belonging to the same total theme.

<p><span class="font17">example, in collecting I do not allow what I just perceptually seized upon to escape while I turn the seizing regard to the new Object.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;254&gt; Demonstrating an argument, step by step I run through the thoughts which are premises; I abandon no synthetical step that I have acquired, nor do I lose my grip on it; however, the mode of action-ality has essentially changed with the effectuation of the new thematic primal actionality.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">In that connection it is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">also,</span><span class="font17"> though not </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">merely^</span><span class="font17"> a matter of obscurations. The differences we have just tried to describe rather exhibit a completely new dimension in contradistinction to the difFerences of clarity and unclarity, although both sets of differences are quite closely interwoven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We may further observe that these new differences fall under the law ofthe correlation ofnoesis and noema no less than those of clarity and all other differences in intentionality. Thus, again, the noetic actionality-modifications correspond to the species of noematic modifications which belong here. For example: the mode of givenness of the &quot;meant as meant&quot; changes in the variation of positing, or in the steps of the synthesis, and one can show these changes in the particular noematic content and make them salient in it as a stratum proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When the actionality-mode (stated noematically, the givenness-mode) -disregarding the changes in continuous flux — necessarily varies according to certain </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">discrete types,</span><span class="font17"> there still always remains throughout the variations something essentially common. Noemat-ically, a What is preserved as the identical </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sense;</span><span class="font17"> on the noetic side, the correlate of this sense, furthermore the whole form of articulation according to positing and synthesizing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, a new eidetic modification now occurs. The pure Ego can </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">withdraw</span><span class="font17"> wholly from the positing; it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">releases</span><span class="font17"> the positional corre-latc /rom </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its &quot;grip</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">' &quot;aduerting to another themed</span><span class="font17"> What was a moment ago still its theme (theoretical, axiological, and so forth), with its articulations, even though more or less obscured, has not disappeared from consciousness; it is still intended to, but no longer in the thematic grip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This holds likewise for isolated positings as well as for members of synthesizings. While thinking about something, a whistle from the street momentarily distracts me from my theme (here the theme of my thinking). For a moment I advert to the noise, but then immediately return to the old theme. The seizing upon the noise has not</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">been effaced, the whistle is still intended to in a modified way</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> however, it is no longer in my mental grip. It does not belong to the theme, nor even to a parallel theme. Note that this possibility of &lt;255&gt; simultaneously, perhaps mutually </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>Qi</sup>penetrating'</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;disruptiu* themata</span><span class="font17"> and of thematic syntheses, refers to still further possible modifications; we note then how the heading </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^theme,&quot;</span><span class="font17"> related to all basic species of acts and act-syntheses, makes up an important theme of phenomenological analysis.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§ 123. Confusion and Distinctness as Modes of Effectuation of Synthetical Acts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Let us now consider further the modalities of effectuation which, so to speak, lie in a converse direction from the preferred mode of actionality arising originaliter. A thought, furnished with simple or manifold positings, can arise as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>iC</sup>confused.^</span><span class="font17"> It is then given as a simple presentation without any actional-positional articulation. Perhaps we recall a proof, a theory, a conversation — it &quot;just comes to mind.&quot; At first we do not even advert to it; it comes up &quot;in the background.&quot; Then a regard of the Ego is directed to it in a single ray, seizing upon the noematic objectivity in question in an unmembered grip. Now a new process can begin, the confused recollection being converted into a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">distinct</span><span class="font17"> and clear one: step by step we remember the course of the proof, we &quot;regenerate&quot; the positings and synthesizings pertaining to the proof, we &quot;recapitulate&quot; the stages of yesterday's conversation, and so fi</span><span class="font11">)</span><span class="font17">rth. Naturally, such reproduction by way of recollection, of regeneration of &quot;earlier&quot; originary generations, is something non-essential. Perhaps a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font17"> theoretical idea for carrying out a complicated theory comes to mind in a unitary but confused way, which is then developed in freely effected steps and transformed into synthetical actualities. Everything indicated is without question to be related in the same wav to all species of act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This important difference between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">confusion</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">distinctness</span><span class="font17"> plays a significant role in the phenomenology of &quot;expressings,'' explicit objectivatingsjudgings </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[Urteile],</span><span class="font17"> emotional acts, etc., which we have yet to examine. We need only think of the way in which we are accustomed to seize upon very complex, synthetical formations making up the ''intellectual content” of our reading at a given time, and reflect on what, in the understanding of what we have re</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17">, comes to actual originary actualization with respect to the so</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17">ca e intellectual foundations of expressions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&lt;256&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§124. The Noetic-Noematic Stratum of</span><span class="font17"> &quot;Logos.&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Signifying and Signification.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Interwoven with all the acts considered before are the expressive act-strata, which are ''logical'' in the specific sense, in which the parallelism between noesis and noema is to be made evident no less than in the other acts. The universal and unavoidable ambiguity of locutions conditioned by this parallelism, and shown to be at work wherever the relevant relationships are expressed in language, is, naturally, also found in the terms expression and signification. The ambiguity is dangerous only as long as one does not recognize it as dangerous, or else has not separated the parallel structures. But if that occurs, care must be taken so that there can be no doubt as to which of the structures the terms ought to be referred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We begin with the familiar distinction between the sensuous, so to speak, the corporeal side of the expression, and its non-sensuous or &quot;mental&quot; side. We need not enter into a closer examination of the first side; likewise, we need not consider the manner of unifying both sides. Obviously they too designate headings for not unimportant phenomenological problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We shall restrict our regard exclusively to &quot;signifying&quot; and &quot;sig</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> ni^ication.^<sup>,</sup> Originally, these words concerned only the linguistic sphere, that of &quot;expressing.&quot; But one can scarcely avoid and, at the same time, take an important cognitive step, extending the signification of these words and suitably modifying them so that they can find application of a certain kind to the whole noetic-noematic sphere: thus application to all acts, be they now combined with expressive acts or not.<sup>86</sup> Thus we have continued to speak of <sup>tt</sup>sense^<sup>, </sup>in the case of all intentive mental processes — a word which is used in general as equivalent to &quot;signification.'' For the sake of distinctness we shall prefer the term </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">signification</span><span class="font17"> for the old concept and, in particular, in the complex locution of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>Ci</sup>logical^</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>iC</sup>expressive^ signification.</span><span class="font17"> We shall continue to use the word </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sense</span><span class="font17"> as before in the most all-inclusive range.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">normal custom after first seizing upon something perceptually, we effect an explicating of the given and a relational positing which unifies the parts or moments singled out — perhaps according to the schema, &quot;This is white.<sup>5,</sup> This process does not require the minimum of &quot;expression,&quot; nor of expression in the sense of verbal sound, nor of anything like a verbal signifying, the latter also being capable of being present independently of the verbal sound (as when this would be &quot;forgotten''). But if we have </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;thought&quot; ot asserted,</span><span class="font17"> ''This is white,&quot; then a new stratum is co-present, unified with the purely perceptually &quot;meant as meant.&quot; In this fashion anything remembered as remembered, anything phantasied as phantasied, is also explicatable and expressable. Anything &quot;meant as meant,&quot; anything meant in the noematic sense (and, more particularly, as the noematic core) pertaining to any act, no matter which, is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">expressable by means</span><span class="font17"> of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^significationsy</span><span class="font17"> Quite universally we may say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logical signification is an expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The verbal sound can only be called an expression because the signification belonging to it expresses; expressing inheres in it originaliter. '.Expression'' is a distinctive form which allows for adapting to every &quot;sense&quot; (to the noematic &quot;core&quot;) and raises it to the realm of &quot;Logos,&quot; of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">conceptual</span><span class="font17"> and, on that account, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universal.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As a consequence, the last words are understood in a quite determinate signification to be separated from other significations of these words. Universally, what has just been indicated designates a major theme for phenomenological analysis which is fundamental for eidet-ically clarifying logical thinking and its correlates. In the noetic respect, a particular act-stratum should be designated under the heading of &quot;expressing&quot; to which, in their own peculiar way, all other acts are to conform and with which they are to fuse in a distinctive manner so that every noematic act-sense, and consequently the relationship to objectivity lying in it, is ''conceptually'' stamped on the noematic correlate of the expressing. An appertinent intuitional medium is present which, according to its essence, has the distinction, so to speak, of mirroring every other intentionality according to form and content, depicturing it in its own colors and hence imprinting on it its own form of &quot;conceptuality. To be sure, these locutions of mirroring or depicturing imposed upon us are to be taken with care since their metaphorical use can easily lead to error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Extraordinarily diflicult problems are related to the phenomena &lt;2 /</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">subsumed under the headings of <sup>tc</sup>signi^ying^^ and &quot;signification.<sup>,</sup></span><span class="font11"><sup>，</sup></span><span class="font17"><sup>87 </sup>Because every science is objectivated in the specifically &quot;logical&quot; medium, in that of expression, in accord with its theoretical content and with everything which is &quot;doctrine&quot; in it (theorem, proof theory), the problems of expression and signification are the most immediate for philosophers and psychologists guided by universal logical interests; and they are, therefore, the first to require a phenomenological inquiry into essence as soon as one seriously comes to seek out their ground.<sup>88</sup> From there, on that basis, one is led to the question of how the &quot;expressing&quot; of the &quot;expressed&quot; is to be understood, how expressive mental processes are related to non-expressive ones, and what the latter undergo in supervening expressings: one finds himself referred to their &quot;intentionality,&quot; to the &quot;sense imma-nent^^ in them, to the &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; (i.e., the act-characteristic of the positing); &lt;one is referred to&gt;the diflerence between these senses, to the essential moments which lie in the preexpressed, and to the signification of the expressive phenomenon itself and its own moments; and so forth. In many ways, one still sees in the current literature how little justice is done to the major problems indicated here with respect to their full and profound sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Apart from the fact that it confers expression precisely on all other intentionalities, the stratum of expression -- and this makes up its own peculiarity -— is not productive. Or, if one wishes: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its productivity, its noematic production, is exhausted in the expressing</span><span class="font17"> and with the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">form of the conceptual</span><span class="font17"> which is introduced with &lt;the expression&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As a consequence, the expressive stratum, with respect to the posited characteristic, is perfectly identical in essence with the stratum undergoing the expression, and in the coincidence takes up its essence into itself to such an extent that we call the expressive objectivating just objectivating itself the expressive believing, &lt;expressive&gt; deeming likely, &lt;expressive&gt; doubting themselves, and as a whole, just believing, deeming likely, doubting; similarly, we call the expressive wishing or willing just wishing or willing. It is evident </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">259</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">that even the distinction between positionality and neutrality passes</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">over into the expressive, and we have already considered it above. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">expressive stratum can have no other qualified posited or neutral position than the stratum subject to the expression,</span><span class="font17"> and in the coincidence we find not two positions which are to be separated but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">only one position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">89The full clarification of the structures belonging here raises considerable difficulties. Already it is not easy to recognize that, after abstraction from the sensuous verbal sounds, a stratification of the kind we presuppose here is actually present, thus in every case — even in that ofa thinking which is still quite unclear, empty, merely verbal — a stratum of expressive signifying and a substratum of the expressed; nor is it easy to understand the essential connections of these stratifications. For not too much should be expected of the metaphor stratification; expression is not something like a coat of varnish, or like a piece of clothing covering it over; it is a mental formation exercizing new intentive functions on the intentive substratum and which, correlatively, is subjected to the intentive functions of the &lt;substratum&gt;. What this new metaphor signifies for its part must be studied in the phenomena themselves and in all their essential modifications. Of particular importance is the understanding of the different sorts of &quot;universality” which make their appearance there: on the one side, those which belong to each expression and moment of expression, also to the non-selfsufficient &quot;is,” &quot;not,&quot; <sup>^t</sup>and,^^ &quot;i</span><span class="font7">。&quot; </span><span class="font17">and so forth; on the other side, the universality of &quot;universal names&quot; such as &quot;human being” in contrast to proper names such as <sup>^t</sup>Bruno;^^ again, those which belong to an essence which, in itself is syntactically formless in comparison to the different universalities of signification just touched upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§ 125. The Modalities of Effectuation in the Logical-Expressive Sphere and the Method of Clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In order to clear up the difficulties indicated particular regard must obviously be directed to the differences in modes of actionality dealt with above:<sup>90</sup> the modalities of act-effectuation which, like all positings and synthesizings, concern as well the expressive modalities. But</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">this occurs in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font17"> way. On the one hand, they concern the signification-stratum, the specifically logical itself; on the other hand, the founding substrata.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;260&gt; In the course of reading we can articulate and freely effect each signification; we can, as a consequence, synthetically connect significations with significations in the predesignated way. In this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">effectuation of acts of signification in the mode ofproduction proper</span><span class="font17"> we acquire perfect </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">distinctness of<sup>ec</sup>logical&quot; understanding.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">This distinctness can be converted into confusion in all the modes described above: the sentence just read sinks into darkness, loses its living articulation, ceases to be our &quot;theme,&quot; to be &quot;still in grip.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Such distinctness and confusion are, however, to be separated - from that which affects the expressed substrata. A distinct understanding of word and sentence (or a distinct, articulated effectuation of the act of stating) is compatible with the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">confusion belonging to the substrata^<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font17"> This confusion does not signify mere unclarity, although it can </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">also</span><span class="font17"> signify that. The substratum can be a confused unitary something (and often is) which does not actually include in itself its articulation; but instead it owes &lt;its articulation&gt; to mere adaptation to the stratum of the logical expression actually articulated and effected in original actionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">That has a highly important methodological signification. We call attention to the fact that essential supplementations are needed by our earlier discussions about the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">method of clarification<sup>92</sup></span><span class="font17"> with respect to the proposition, which is the element of life in science. It is now easy to designate what needs to be done in order to come from confused thinking to genuine and fully explicit cognizing, to distinct and, at the same time, clear effectuation of acts of thinking: In the first place, all</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>(C</sup> logical&quot;' acts</span><span class="font17"> f </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">those of signifying</span><span class="font7"> 九 </span><span class="font17">in so far as they were still effected in the mode of confusion, are to be converted into the mode of originary, spontaneous actionality; thus perfect </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">logical distinctness</span><span class="font17"> is to be established. But now the analogue is also to be produced in the grounding </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">substratum,</span><span class="font17"> everywhere unliving is to be converted into the living, all confusion into distinctness, but also all non-intuitiveness into intuitiveness.<sup>93</sup> Only when we perform this work &lt;of conversion&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">in the substratum — in the event that the incompatibilities becoming visible in it do not make further work superfluous — does the previously described method come into action, whereby account is to be taken of the fact that the concept of intuition, of clear consciousness, is transferred from the monothetical to the synthetical acts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Moreover, as a profdunder analysis will show, it all depends on the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">species of evidence</span><span class="font17"> which should be acquired in each case, or else on the stratum to which the evidence is turned. All evidences related to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure-logical</span><span class="font17"> relations, to concatenations of essences of noematic significations —-therefore those which we obtain from fundamental laws of formal logic — require precisely the givenness of significations, namely, the givenness of expressive posita of the forms prescribed by the law of signi-fication in question. The non-selfsufficiency of significations also brings it about that exemplification of the logically produced essence-formation mediating the evidence of the law also carries along with it substrata and, more particularly, those subjected to logical expression; but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">these substrata need not be made clear when it is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> matter of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> pure-logical insight.</span><span class="font17"> Correspondingly modified, that holds for all &quot;analytic” cognitions.<sup>94</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§126 . Completeness and Universality of Expression.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">To be emphasized, furthermore, is the difference between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">complete </span><span class="font17">and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">incomplete</span><span class="font17"> expression.<sup>95</sup> The unity of something which expresses and something which is expressed in the phenomenon is, to be sure, that of a certain coincidence, although it is not necessary that the superstratum be expressively extended over the whole substratum. The expression is complete when it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">stamps</span><span class="font17"> all </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">synthetical forms and materials of the substratum in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> conceptual-significational way;</span><span class="font17"> it is incomplete when it only partially does that: as when, with respect to a complex event, such as the arrival of a carriage, perhaps, bringing long-awaited guests, we shout in the house: the carriage! the guests! —Obviously this difference of completeness cuts across that of relative clarity and distinctness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An incompleteness wholly different from the one just mentioned is that which belongs to the essence of expression as expression, that is</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">to say, to its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universality.</span><span class="font17"> <sup>&lt;C</sup>I would like&quot; universally expresses the wish; the form of the command, the command; ''might well be” expresses the deeming likely, or what is deemed likely as likely; and so forth. Everything determined more precisely in the unity of expression is itself again expressed universally. It is inherent in the sense of the universality belonging to the essence of expressing that all the part-&lt;262&gt; iculars of the expressed can never be reflected in the expression. The stratum of signifying is not, and of essential necessity cannot be, a kind of reduplication of the substratum. Whole dimensions of variability in the substratum do not enter at all into the expressive signifying; they, or their correlates, do not indeed &quot;express themselves&quot; at all: thus the modifications of relative clarity and distinctness, the attentional modifications, and so forth. But even in that which indicates the particular sense of the word expression there subsist essential differences, thus with respect to how the synthetical forms and the synthetical stuff find expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Reference is also to be made here to the <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>non-sel^sufficiency<sup>,</sup>^ of all forms of significations and all <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>syncatego^ematic^^ significations taken universally. The isolated &quot;and J &quot;ig'' the isolated genitive &quot;of the heavens J are comprehensible and yet are non-selfsufficient and in need of completion. The question here is what this need of completion signifies, what it signifies with respect to both strata and in retrospect of the possibilities of incomplete signifying.<sup>96</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. The Expression ofJudgments and the Expression of Emotional Noemas.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">All these points must be clarified if one of the oldest and most difficult of problems pertaining to the sphere of signification is to be solved — a problem which has remained without solution until now precisely because it has lacked the requisite phenomenological insights: the problem of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">how statings as the expressions of judging are related to the expressing of other sorts of acts.</span><span class="font17"> We have expressive predications in which a &quot;thus it is!&quot; is expressed. We have expressive deemings likely, askings, doubtings, expressive wishes, commands; etc. Verbally, we find here proposition-forms structured in the way peculiar to them but which are to be interpreted ambiguously: along with predicative</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">propositions there are interrogative propositions, presumptionpropositions, optative propositions, imperative propositions, etc. Leaving aside grammatical wordings and their historical forms, the original argument in that connection was related to whether or not all of these propositions with respect to their signification were not in truth predicative propositions. In the latter case, all pertinent act-formations, e.g., those of the emotional sphere which, in themselves, are not acts ofjudging, would only be able to come to &quot;expression&quot; in a roundabout way by means of a judging founded on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Nonetheless, the whole relation of the problem to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">acts,</span><span class="font17"> the noeses, is insufficient, and the continual overlooking of the noemata to which the regard is directed just in such reflections on significations, hinders the understanding of these affairs. In order to be able to penetrate to the correct setting of the problem, universally it is necessary to refer to the different structures we have indicated: the universal cognition of the noetic and noematic correlations as one which pervades all intentionalities, all posited and synthesized strata; likewise the separation of the logical signification-stratum from the substratum to be expressed by it; furthermore, the insight here, as elsewhere in the intentive sphere, into the essentially possible directions of reflection and the directions of modifications; but, specifically, there is needed the insight into the ways in which each consciousness is converted into a judgmental consciousness, just as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">predicatively formed affair-complexes</span><span class="font17"> of noetic and noematic kinds are to be drawn from every consciousness. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">radical problem</span><span class="font17"> back to which we are finally led, as it emerges from the concatenation of the whole series of the last problem-analyses, is to be formulated as follows:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;263&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Is the medium of expressive signifying,</span><span class="font17"> this appertinent medium of the Logos, </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">specifically doxic one?</span><span class="font17"> In the adaptation of the signifying to the signified, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">does it not coincide with the doxic itself inherent in all positionality?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Of course that would not exclude the fact that many modes of expression, let us say of emotional mental processes, are given. One of them would be the direct, i.e., simple expressions of men tai processes (or for the correlative sense of the word expression, its noema) by the immediate adaptation of a membered expression to the membered emotional mental process whereby the doxic coincides with the doxic. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doxic</span><span class="font17"> form inherent in the emotional mental process with respect to all components would thus be what makes possible the adaptability of the expression, as an exclusively doxo-positional mental process, to the emotional mental process which, as emo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">tional and according to all its members, is multi-positing but also necessarily including doxo-positional &lt;members&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">More precisely stated, this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">direct</span><span class="font17"> expression, ifit is to be a faithful and complete expression, would only accrue to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doxic^ non-modalized mental processes.</span><span class="font17"> Ig in wishing, I am uncertain, it is then incorrect to say in direct adaptation: May S be p. For all expressing is, in the sense &lt;264&gt; of the foundational apprehension, a doxic act in the pregnant sense, i.e., a certainty of believing.<sup>97</sup>It can, therefore, only express certainties (e.g., wish-certainties, volitional certainties).<sup>98</sup> In cases of that kind, the expression is only produced as indirectly faithful, perchance in the form: &quot;Perhaps S may be p.” As soon as modalities make their appearance, in order to acquire the most suitable expression possible it is necessary to recurr to the doxic positings with changed positional material which lie, so to speak, hidden in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we grant this interpretation as a correct one, then the following must still be pointed out by way of supplement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There are at all times a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">number</span><span class="font17"> of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">possibilities of indirect expressions </span><span class="font17">with &quot;periphrases.<sup>55</sup> To the essence of any objectivity as objectivity, be it constituted by no matter which acts, be the acts simple or complex and synthetically founded acts, there belong various possibilities of relating explication: thus different acts can follow upon any act, e.g., an act of wishing, related to it, to its noematic objectivity, to its entire noema; concatenations of subject-positings, of predicate- positings posited thereupon in which, perchance, what is meant in the original act of wishing isjudgmentally unfolded and correspondingly expressed. The expression is then </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font17"> adapted to the phenomenon originaliter, but instead </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">directly</span><span class="font17"> to that which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">predicatively derived</span><span class="font17"> from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this connection it is always necessary to note that, &lt;on the one side&gt; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">explicative</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">analytic synthesis</span><span class="font17"> (judgment prior to the conceptual-significational expression), on the other side statement of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">judgment in the ordinary sense</span><span class="font17"> and, finally, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doxa</span><span class="font17"> (belief </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[belief])<sub>}</sub></span><span class="font17"> are matters which must be kept well separated.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§128 . Introduction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">The phenomenological excursions of the last chapter have led us into almost all spheres of intentionality. Guided by the radical point of view of the distinction between analysis of the really inherent and intentional analysis, between noetic and noematic analysis, we encountered in all cases structures which always and again became newly ramified. In the case of this distinction, we can no longer avoid the insight that it is indeed a matter of a fundamental structure pervading all intentional structures which must, therefore, determine a governing </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Leitmotiv</span><span class="font17"> of phenomenological methods and the course of all inquiries into problems of intentionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With this distinction it is clear at the same time that there becomes salient a distinction between two realms ofbeing which are radically opposed and yet essentially related to one another. We emphasized earlier that consciousness taken universally must be accepted as a proper region of being. We recognized then, however, that eidetic description of consciousness leads back to that of what is intended to in it, that the correlate of consciousness is inseparable from consciousness and yet is not really inherent in it. The noematic became distinguished as an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">objectivity</span><span class="font17"> belonging to consciousness and yet </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">specifically peculiar.</span><span class="font17"> In that connection, we notice that while objects simpliciter (understood in the unmodified sense) stand under fundamentally different highest genera, all object-senses and all noemas taken completely, no matter how different they may be otherwise, are of essential necessity of one single highest genus. It then also obtains, however, that the essences, Noema and Noesis, are inseparable from one another: Infima species on the noematic side eidet-ically point back to infima species on the noetic side. That becomes extended naturally to all formations of genus and species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Cognitions of the essential two-sidedness of intentionality, according to noesis and noema, have the consequence that a systematic &lt;266&gt; phenomenology is not allowed to direct its aim one-sidedly at an analysis of what is really inherent in mental processes and specifically of intentive mental processes. The temptation to do so is, however, very great at the beginning because the historical and natural course from psychology to phenomenology brings with it that one understands the study of what is immanent in pure mental processes, the study of their own essence, as without question a study of their really inherent components.<sup>1</sup> In truth there become opened up in respect of both sides great provinces of eidetic research which are continually related to one another and which yet, as comes to light, are separated with respect to broad extents. In great measure what one has held to be act-analysis, noetic analysis, is gained entirely from the direction of regard to the &quot;meant as meant,&quot; and thus it was noematic structures which one described in that analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In our next considerations it will be our purpose to direct our attention to the universal structure of the noema from a point of view which, up to now, has often been mentioned but was still not the guiding one for noematic analysis: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The phenomenological problem of the relation of consciousness to an objectivity</span><span class="font17"> has primarily its noematic side. The noema in itself has an objective relation and, more particularly, by virtue of its own &quot;sense.&quot; If we ask, then, how the consciousness-&quot;sense&quot; has access to the &quot;o</span><span class="font7">切</span><span class="font17">ect&quot; which belongs to it and can be &quot;the same<sup>55</sup> in manifold acts of very different content, how we see this in the sense, then new structures emerge the extraordinary significance of which is evident. For, progressing in this direction and, on the other side, reflecting on the parallel noeses, we finally confront the question of what the &quot;claim&quot; of consciousness actually to &quot;relate&quot; to something objective, to be <sup>^^</sup>well-fbunded,^^ properly signifies, ofhow &quot;valid&quot; and “invalid&quot; objective relations become phenomenologically clarified according to noesis and noema: and with that we confront the great </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">problems of reason,</span><span class="font17"> the clarification of which within the realm of phenomenology, the formulation of which as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenological</span><span class="font17"> problems, will become our aim in this &lt;fdurth&gt; part of &lt;the First Book&gt;.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§129 . &quot;Content&quot; and<sup>C(</sup>Object;^ the Content as &quot;Sense.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">In our previous analyses a universal noematic structure played its continuous role, designated by the separation of a certain </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic</span><span class="font17"> &lt;267&gt; ''core'' from the changing </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;characteristics^</span><span class="font17"> belonging to it &lt;and&gt; with which the noematic concretion appears involved in the flow of different sorts of modifications. This core has not yet received its scientific due. It was intuitionally, unitarily, and clearly salient so that we could refer to it in general. Now the time has come to consider it more closely and place it at the center of phenomenological analysis. As soon as one does that, universally significant differences running throughout all act-species emerge which are guiding for great groups of investigations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We begin with the usual equivocal verbal reference to the content of consciousness. As content we take the &quot;sense J of which we say that in or through it consciousness relates to something objective as &quot;its&quot; something objective. So to speak, as title and aim of our discussions we take the propositions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Each noema has a</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>C(</sup>content^</span><span class="font17"> that is to say, its &quot;sense,&quot; and is related through it to &quot;its&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In recent times one often hears it praised as a great advance, that now at last the foundation-laying differentiation among act, content, and object has been attained. The three words in this juxtaposition have become nothing short of slogans, particularly since Twardowski's fine treatise.<sup>2</sup> Yet, however great and doubtless the service of this author in having acutely discussed certain generally ordinary confusions and made their error evident, it must still be said that in the clarification of the relevant conceptual essence he did not get considerably beyond what was well-known to the philosophers of earlier generations (despite their incautious confusions). This is not, perchance, to be charged to him as a fault. A radical advance wasjust not at all possible before a systematic phenomenology of consciousness. With phenomenologically unclarified concepts such as &quot;act,&quot; &quot;content J &quot;object&quot; of the <sup>tt</sup>objectivatings,^^ nothing is of help to us. What is there which cannot be called </span><span class="font7">&quot;〃以''</span><span class="font17">and especially which cannot be called &quot;content of an objectivating,^^ and an <sup>4t</sup>objectivat-ing?” And what can be called so must itself be cognized scientifically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this respect a first and, as it would appear to me, necessary step was attempted by means of the phenomenological distinguishing of &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; by means of the idea of the &quot;intentional essence&quot; in its distinction from the &quot;cognitional essence.<sup>,?</sup> The onesidedness of the noetic direction of regard in which these differen-&lt;268&gt; tiations were made and meant becomes easily overcome by taking into consideration the noematic parallels. We can therefore understand the concepts as noematic; the &quot;quality&quot; (judgment-quality, wish-quality, and so forth) is nothing else than that which we have dealt with up to now as &quot;posited&quot; characteristic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[&quot;Setzungs&quot; Charakter, <sup>Ci</sup>thetischeTC' Charakter]</span><span class="font17"> in the broadest sense. The expression, orginat-ing from contemporary psychology (Brentano's), appears to me now hardly suitable; each specifically peculiar position has its quality but it is not itself to be designated as quality. Obviously now the &quot;matter,&quot; which is, in the particular case, the &quot;what&quot; which receives the posited characteristic, the &quot;quality,&quot; corresponds to the '<sup>4</sup>noematic core.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The task is now to systematically develop this beginning, to clarify it more deeply, to analyze these concepts further and to carry them through in all noetic-noematic provinces. Each actually successful advance in this direction must be of exceptional significance for phenomenology. It is indeed a question, not of side issues, but of essential moments belonging to the central structure of every intentive mental process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In order to approach matters more closely, let us begin with the following deliberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The intentive mental process, so one is accustomed to say, has </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^relation to something objective;&quot;</span><span class="font17"> but one also says that it is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;consciousness of something</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> for example, a blossoming apple tree, the one here in this garden. To begin with, we shall not hold it to be necessary, in the light of such examples, to discriminate the two manners of speaking. If we recall the preceding analyses, we find the full noesis related to the full noema as its intentional and full What. It is then clear, however, that this relation cannot be the one meant in speaking of the relation of consciousness to its intentional objective something; for to each noetic moment, especially to each positing noetic one, there corresponds a moment in the noema and, in the latter, there is set apart from the complex posited characteristics the noematic core characterized by them. If we recall, furthermore, the &quot;regard-to&quot; which, under circumstances, goes through the noesis (which goes</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">through the actional cogito) and which converts the specifically positing moments into rays of positing actionality of the Ego, and if we heed precisely how this Ego now with them &quot;directs&quot; itself to something objective as seizing upon being, as deeming likely, as wishing, how its regard goes through the noematic core — we then become attentive to the fact that, with the statements about the relation (and specifically the direction) of consciousness to its objective something, we are referred to an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">innermost</span><span class="font17"> moment of the noema. It is not the just designated core itself but rather something else which, so to speak, makes up the necessary central point of the core and functions as &quot;bearer&quot; for noematic peculiarities specifically belonging to the core, that is to say, the noematically modified properties of the &quot;meant as meant.&quot;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;269&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">As soon as we go into it more precisely we are immediately cognitively aware that indeed the distinction between &quot;content&quot; and &quot;object'' is to be made not only for the ^consciousness/<sup>5</sup> for the intentive mental process, but also for the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noema taken in itself.</span><span class="font17"> Thus the noema too is related to an object and possesses a &quot;content” by &quot;means” of which it relates to the object; in which case the object is the same as that of the noesis; as then the ’’parallelism'' again completely confirms itself</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Let us bring these remarkable structures closer to us. We simplify the deliberation in such a way that we leave the attentional modifications out of consideration; we restrict ourselves further to positing acts in the positions of which we live, perhaps, according to the sequence of levels of the founding — living sometimes in the one, sometimes in the other partial position while the others are, it is true, in effect but in a secondary function. That our analyses do not suffer in the least with respect to the universality of their validity by such simplifications is to be made evident subsequently and without further ado. We are concerned precisely with an essence which is insensitive to such modifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we then put ourselves into a living cogito, it has, according to its</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font17">essence and in a pre-eminent sense a &quot;direction&quot; to something objective. In other words, there belongs to its noema ''something objective^^ ——in inverted commas ——with a certain noematic composition which becomes explicated in a description of determinate delimitation, that is to say, in such a description which, as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">description of the &quot;meant objective something, as it is meant</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">' avoids all &quot;subjective&quot; expressions.</span><span class="font17"> There formal-ontological expressions are applied, such as <sup>&lt;^</sup>object,^^ &quot;determination</span><span class="font11">，</span><span class="font17">' &lt;and&gt; &quot;predicatively formed afiair-complex;^^ material-ontological expressions, such as ''physical thing,&quot; &quot;bodily figure&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[&quot;F</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">，</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">〃产],</span><span class="font17">&lt;and&gt; &quot;cause;&quot; determinations with a material content, such as &quot;rough J &quot;hard J &lt;and&gt; &quot;colored&quot; —all have their inverted commas, accordingly the noematic-modified sense. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Excluded,</span><span class="font17"> in contrast, for the description of this meant objective something as meant are such expressions as &quot;perceptual J</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;270&gt; &quot;memorial J &quot;clearly intuited J &quot;conceptual J and &quot;given&quot; — they belong to another dimension of descriptions, not to the objective something </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">which</span><span class="font17"> is an object of consciousness, but to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mode in which it is an object of consciousness.</span><span class="font17"> In contrast, in the case of an appearing physical thing-Object, it would again fall in the bounds of the description to say: a '&quot;front side&quot; is thus and so </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">determinedv/i\h</span><span class="font17"> respect to color, shape, etc., its &quot;rear side&quot; has &quot;a color&quot; but a &quot;not further determined&quot; one; the appearing physical thing-Object is, in these and those respects, altogether </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;undetermined^</span><span class="font17"> as to whether it is thus or so.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">That is true not only in the case of objects belonging to Nature but quite universally; for example, in the case of objects with value. To their description belongs that of the meant &quot;mere thing&quot; and, in addition, the statement of the &quot;value,&quot; as when we say of the appearing tree, ''according to the sense&quot; of our valuing-meaning &lt;of it&gt;, it is covered with <sup>&lt;^</sup>delightfully^^ scented blossoms. Moreover, the value predicates too have their inverted commas; they are predicates, not of a valuable object </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[eines Wertes]</span><span class="font17"> simpliciter, but of a value noema.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With this, obviously, a quite </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fixed content in each noema</span><span class="font17"> is delimited. Each consciousness has its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">What</span><span class="font17"> and each means &quot;its&quot; objective something; it is evident that, in the case of each consciousness, we must, essentially speaking, be able to make such a noematic description of&lt;<sup>&lt;^</sup>its^^ objective something&gt;, ''precisely as it is meant;'' we acquire by explication and conceptual comprehension a closed set of formal or material, materially determined or &quot;undetermined&quot; (&quot;emp</span><span class="font11">・</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">lily&quot; meant<sup>4</sup>) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">''predicates'<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font17"> and these in their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">modified signification </span><span class="font17">determine that &quot;co</span><span class="font7">几％几</span><span class="font17">F' of the object-core of the noema which is spoken of.<sup>5</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§131. The <sup>Ci</sup>Object,&quot; the <sup>Ci</sup>Determinable X in the Noematic Sense</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">：</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">The predicates are, however, predicates of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;something</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> and this &quot;something&quot; also belongs, and obviously inseparably, to the core in question: it is the central point of unity of which we spoke above. It is the central point of connection or the &quot;bearer&quot; of the predicates, but in no way is it a unity of them in the sense in which any complex, any combination, of the predicates would be called a unity. It is necessarily to be distinguished from them, although not to be placed alongside and separated from them; just as, conversely, they are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font17"> &lt;271&gt; predicates: unthinkable without it, yet distinguishable from it. We say that the intentional Object is continuously intended to in the continuous or synthetical course of consciousness but again and again &quot;presents&quot; itself &quot;dififerently</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17">&quot; it is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>Ci</sup>lhe same'&quot;'</span><span class="font17"> it is only given in other predicates with a different determination-content; &quot;it&quot; shows itself only from different sides, whereby the predicates which remained undetermined would have become more closely determined; or &quot;the&quot; Object has remained unchanged in this stretch of givenness, now however &quot;it,&quot; the identical, becomes altered, it increases in beauty through this alteration, it loses utility-value, and so forth. If this is always understood as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic description</span><span class="font17"> of the currently meant as meant and if this description, as is possible at any time, is made in pure adequation, then the identical intentional &quot;o</span><span class="font7">切</span><span class="font17">ect&quot; becomes evidently distinguished from the changing and alterable <sup>44</sup>predicates.<sup>,5</sup> It becomes separated as central noematic moment: the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“。切</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ect&quot;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">『</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">GegensSncT],</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">“Object&quot;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">『</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ObjekW],</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">“Identical</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">」</span><span class="font17">the &quot;determinable subject of its possible predicates&quot; — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the pure X in abstraction from all predicates</span><span class="font17"> — and it becomes separated </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font17"> these predicates or, more precisely, from the predicate-noemas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> Object we coordinate multiple modes of consciousness, acts, correlatively act-noemas. Obviously this is nothing accidental; no &lt;Object&gt; is conceivable without there also being conceivable multiple intentive mental processes, connected in continuous or in properly synthetical (polythetical) unity — processes in which &quot;it J the Object, is intended to as an identical object and yet in a noetically different mode: such that the characterized core is a changeable one and the <sup>Ct</sup>object<sup>,,</sup><sub>)</sub> the pure subject of the predicating, is precisely an identical one. It is clear that we can regard each partial extent of the immanental duration of an act as an &quot;act''6 and the total act as a certain harmonious unity of the continuously combined acts. We can say then: several act-noemata have here, throughout, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">different cores<sup>1</sup>,</span><span class="font17"> yet in such a manner that, in spite of this, they </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^rejoined together to make a unity of identity,</span><span class="font17"> to make a unity in which the &quot;something,&quot; the determinable which inheres in each core, is intended to as an identical &quot;something.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In just the same manner, however, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">separate</span><span class="font17"> acts, like, for example, two perceptions or a perception and a memory, can join together to make a &quot;harmonious&quot; unity and by virtue of the specific character of &lt;272&gt; this union, which is obviously not alien to the essence of the acts joined together, there is consciousness of the possibly at one time so and at another time otherwise determined something of the at first </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">separated cores</span><span class="font17"> as the same something or as harmoniously the same <sup>^t</sup>object.^^</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As a consequence, therefore, there is inherent in each noema a pure object-something as a point of unity and, at the same time, we see how in a noematic respect two sorts of object-concepts are to be distinguished: this pure point of unity, this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">noematic &quot;object simpli-</span><span class="font17">E”,&quot;8 <sub>a</sub>nd the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^object in the How of its determinations'^</span><span class="font7"> 一 </span><span class="font17">including undeterminednesses which for the time being &quot;remain open&quot; and, in this mode, are co-meant. This &quot;How,&quot; moreover, is to be taken precisely as that which the particular act prescribes, as which it consequently belongs actually to the noema &lt;of the act&gt;. The &quot;ssse,&quot; of which we speak repeatedly, is this noematic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>iC</sup>Object in the How</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Let it be noted that now we cautiously said &quot;sense,&quot; not ''core.'</span><span class="font11">，</span><span class="font17"> For it will turn out that, in order to gain the actual, concretely complete core of the noema, we must take into account yet another dimension of differences which finds no expression in the characterized description &lt;but&gt; which defines the sense for us. If at first we keep here purely to that which this &lt;description&gt; comprehends, the &quot;sense&quot; is therefore a fundamental piece of the noema. Universally it is a piece which, under circumstances, changes from noema to noema, but &lt;which&gt; under circumstances &lt;is&gt; an absolutely like &lt;piece&gt; and perhaps even characterized as &quot;identical J in so far as the &quot;object, in the How of determinations,<sup>,5</sup> stands there on both sides as the same and as one to be described in an absolutely like manner. In no noema, however, can it or its necessary center, the point of unity, the pure determinable X, be missing.

<p><span class="font17">There would now be needed a careful carrying-through of these distinctions in all act-provinces as well as supplementary consideration of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">posited moments</span><span class="font17"> which have a peculiar relation to the sense as noematic. In the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen</span><span class="font17"> they were (under the title &quot;quality&quot;) taken into the concept of sense (of significational essence) and therefore in this unity the two components, <sup>tc</sup>matter<sup>,5</sup> (sense, in the present conception) and quality, were distinguished.<sup>16</sup> But it seems more suitable to define the term &quot;sense&quot; as merely that &quot;matter&quot; and then to designate the unity of sense and posited characteristic as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;positum.”']</span><span class="font17"> We have then </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one-memberedposita</span><span class="font17"> (as in the case of perceptions and other positional intuitions) and manymembered, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">synthetical</span><span class="font17"> posita, such as predicative doxic posita (judgments), uncertain likelihood-posita with predicatively membered material, etc. One-membered as well as many-membered &lt;posita&gt; are, furthermore, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">liking-posita, wish-posita, command-posita,</span><span class="font17"> etc. The concept of the positum is accordingly indeed extraordinarily and perhaps surprisingly broadened, but nevertheless within the bounds of an important essential unity. Continually it is indeed to be kept in view that the concepts sense and positum contain for us nothing pertaining to expression and conceptual signification; on the other hand, however, they comprehend under themselves all explicit posita or, correspondingly, all posita-significations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">According to our analyses these concepts designate an abstract stratum belonging to the full web of all noemata. For our cognitions it is of great significance to gain this stratum in its fully comprehensive universality, consequently to have the insight that it has its place actually in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all act-spheres.</span><span class="font17"> Also in the case of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intuitions</span><span class="font17"> simpliciter the concepts sense and positum have their necessary application, necessarily the particular concepts </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intuition-sense</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intuition-positum</span><span class="font17"> must</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">be coined. So, for example, in the province of perception of something external the object-sense, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">physical thing-sense of this perception^ </span><span class="font17">which is a different sense (as well as with respect to &quot;the same&quot; physical thing) from perception to perception, is to be singled out intuitively from the &quot;perceived object as perceived<sup>55</sup> by abstracting from the characteristic of perceivedness as something inhering in the </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">275</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">noema prior to all explicating and conceiving thinking. If we take this sense &lt;in its&gt; completion, with its intuitional </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fullness,</span><span class="font17"> a determined and very important concept of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">appearance</span><span class="font17"> results.<sup>18</sup> To these senses correspond posita, intuition-posita, objectivation-posita, perceptual posita, and so forth. In a phenomenology of intuition of something external which, as phenomenology has to do, not with objects simpli-citer in an unmodified sense, but with noemas as correlates of noeses, concepts like those brought out here stand at the center of scientific research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we first turn back to the general theme, the further task now arises of systematically distinguishing the fundamental sorts of senses, of simple and of synthetic senses (that is to say, of senses belonging to synthetical acts), of senses of the first and higher levels. Following partly the fundamental sorts of determinations with respect to content, partly the fundamental forms of synthetic formations playing their role for all significational provinces in a like manner, and thus taking into account everything which is, without exception, determinative a priori for the general structure of senses with respect to form and content, all that is common to all spheres of consciousness or is peculiar to generically closed spheres — we ascend to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">idea of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> systematic and universal doctrine of the forms of senses</span><span class="font17"> (significations).

<p><span class="font17">§734. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Doctrine of Apophantic Forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is a principal task here to project a systematic &quot;analytic&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doctrine of the forms of<sup>&lt;c</sup> logical<sup>9}</sup> significations,</span><span class="font17"> respectively such a doctrine of the forms </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^predicative posita,</span><span class="font17"> of’Judgments&quot; in the sense expressed by this word in formal logic, &lt;a doctrino which considers only the forms of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">analytic</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">predicative synthesis</span><span class="font17"> and leaves undetermined the sense-terms entering into these forms.<sup>20</sup> Although this task is a special one, still it has universal significance because the heading, predicative synthesis, designates a class of operations possible with respect to all possible species of sense; everywhere, equally possible operations of explication and of relating apprehension of the explicated: as determination of the subject of determination, as part of the whole, as relatum of its referent, and so forth. Combined with those &lt;operations&gt; are the &lt;276&gt; operations of collection, of disjunction, of hypothetical connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">All of that prior to all statement and the explicit or &quot;conceptual&quot; comprehension appearing with it for the first time and, as a sig-nificational expression, clinging to all forms and materials.<sup>21</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This doctrine of forms,<sup>22</sup> the idea of which we have repeatedly touched upon before and which, according to our showings, makes up the essentially necessary lower level of a scientific mathesis universalis, loses its isolation because of the results of present investigations; it acquires its home within the universal doctrine of forms of senses of whatever sort ——a doctrine conceived as an idea ——and its ultimate place of origin in noematic phenomenology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us bring that somewhat closer to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Analytic-syntactical operations are, we said,<sup>23</sup> possible operations with respect to all possible sense and posita of whatever determination-content which the noematic sense in question<sup>24</sup> may include <sup>t&lt;</sup>non-explicatec^ly^^ (the noematic sense being actually nothing else than the &quot;meant&quot; object as &quot;meant&quot; and with the particular How of its determination-content). However, it always admits of explication and some operations or other essentially connected with explication (&quot;analysis&quot;) admit of being effected. The synthetical<sup>25</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">forms which thus accrue (in reminiscence of grammatical ''syntaxes<sup>55 </sup>we also called them the syntactical forms) are wholly determinate, belonging to a fixed system of forms; they can be singled out by abstraction and comprehended conceptually-explicitly. Thus, for example, that which is the perceived as perceived in a perceptual position simpliciter can be treated by us analytically in a manner which is indicated in the expressions: &quot;This is black, an inkpot, this black inkpot is not white, is, if white, then not black,&quot; and the like. With each step we have a new sense; instead of the original onemembered positum &lt;we have&gt; a synthetical<sup>26</sup> positum which, according to the law of the expressability of all protodoxic posita, admits of being brought to expression or to predicative statement. Within the membered posita each member has its syntactical form originating from the analytic synthesis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us assume that the positings belonging to these sense-forms are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doxic proto-positings:</span><span class="font17"> then different forms of judgments in the logical sense </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(apophantic posita)</span><span class="font17"> accrue. The aim of determining a priori all these forms, of controlling in systematic completeness the infinitely manifold and yet regulatedly delimited form-formations, designates for us the idea of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">theory of the fonns of apophantic posita, respectively syntaxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">277</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">But positions and, in particular, the synthetical total position can also be </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doxic modalities.</span><span class="font17"> We deem likely, perhaps, and explicate that in the mode &quot;presumably&quot; intended to; or it stands there as questionable and, in the questionability-consciousness, we explicate the questionable; etc. If we give expression to the noematic correlates of these modalities (&quot;S may well be p,&quot; &quot;Is S p?&quot; and the like) and if we do the same also for the unmodified predicative judgment itself, as we also express affirmation and negation (eg: &quot;S is not p.&quot; &quot;Yet S is p,&quot; &quot;S is certainly, actually p&quot;)——</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">then the concept of form</span><span class="font17"> and the idea of the theory of the forms of posita </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is consequently amplified.</span><span class="font17"> The form is now<sup>27</sup> manifoldly determined, partly by means of the properly syntactical forms, partly by means of the doxic modalities. Accordingly, a total position belonging to the total positum always remains, and a doxic position is included in it. At the same time, by means of a senseexplication and predication which converts the modal characteristic into a predication, each such positum and the conceptual &quot;ex</span><span class="font11">・</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">pression'' suitable to it admits ofbeing converted into a predicative proposition, into a judgment which judges </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">about</span><span class="font17"> the modality of a content of such and such a form (e.g., &quot;it is certain, it is possible, probable that S. is p&quot;).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As with judgment-modalities, so it is similarly the case with </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">founded positions</span><span class="font17"> or with senses and posita belonging to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">emotional and volitional spheres,</span><span class="font17"> with the syntheses belonging specifically to them and their corresponding modes of expression. The aim of the new theory of forms of posita and specifically of synthetical posita is then easily indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In this connection, one also sees at the same time </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">that the theory of all posita</span><span class="font17"> is mirrored in </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">suitably amplified theory of forms ofdoxic posita</span><span class="font17"> — if, in precisely the same way as the being-modalities, we include in the judgment-material the modalities of ought to be (providing that the analogous locution is allowed). What this inclusion means certainly does not require a long exposition, but at the most illustration by way of examples: Instead of saying &quot;May S be p,&quot; perhaps &lt;we say&gt;: It may be that S be p, it is desirable (not desired); instead of'S ought to be p:'' It ought to be that S be p, it is something which ought to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Phenomenology itself does not see its task in the systematic elaboration of the theories of forms in which, as is to be learned from the theory of apophantic forms, the systematic possibilities of all &lt;278&gt; further formations become deductively derived from primitive axiomatically fundamental formations; the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">field</span><span class="font17"> &lt;of phenomenology</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">is the analysis of the Apriori which can be legitimated in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">immediate </span><span class="font17">intuition, the fixing of immediately evident essences and concatenations of essences and their descriptive cognition in the systematic combination of all strata in transcendentally pure consciousness. What the theorizing logician isolates in the formal theory of signification by virtue ofhis one-sided direction of interest as something dealt with for itself without heeding and comprehending the noematic and noetic context in which it is phenomenologically interwoven —that the phenomenblogist takes in its full interrelationship. To trace out the phenomenological complex of essences</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">from all sides</span><span class="font17"> is his great task. Every axiomatic legitimation of a fundamental concept in logic becomes a heading for phenomenological investigations. What has already been brought out purely and simply in the broadest logical universality as &quot;positum'' (judgmental positum), as categorical or hypothetical positum, as attributive determination, nomi-nalized adjectivum or relativum, and the like, gives rise to difficult and</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">far-reaching groups of problems of pure phenomenology in so far as &lt;what has been brought out&gt; is set back into the corresponding noematic concatenations of essences from which the theorizing regard has singled it out &lt;in the first place</span><span class="font7">〉.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Just as every intentive mental process has a noema and therein a sense by which it is related to an object, so, conversely, everything which we call </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">object,</span><span class="font17"> of which we speak, which we confront as actuality which we hold as possible or probable, no matter how indeterminately we think it, is precisely therefore already an object of consciousness; and that signifies that whatever world and actuality taken universally may be called, they must be represented in the framework of actual and possible consciousness by corresponding senses or posita filled with more or less intuitive contents. I± as a consequence, phenomenology effects &quot;exclusions,&quot; if &lt;phenomenology&gt; as transcendental parenthesizes all actual positing of realities and effects the other parenthesizings which we have described earlier, then we now understand on the basis of a profbunder ground the sense and rightness of the earlier thesis: that everything excluded </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">279</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">phenomenologically in a certain change of sign still belongs within the boundaries of phenomenology.<sup>28</sup> That is to say, the real and ideal actualities which undergo exclusion are represented in the phenomenological sphere by the total multiplicities of senses and posita corresponding to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For example, each actual physical thing belonging to Nature is thus represented by all the senses and changing fulfilled posita in which it is the correlate of possible intentive mental processes as determined and further determinable thus and so; &lt;it is&gt; therefore represented by the multiplicities of &quot;hill cores&quot; or, which signifies the same thing here, by all possible &quot;'subjective modes of appearance<sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11"><sup>，</sup></span><span class="font17"><sup>2d </sup>in which it can be noematically constituted as identical. But this constitution is related in the first place to an essentially possible individual consciousness, then also to a possible communal con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">sciousness, i.e., to an essentially possible plurality of consciousnessEgos and consciousness-streams standing in &lt;mutual&gt; &quot;exchange J for which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> physical thing is to be intersubjectively given and identified as the same objective actuality. It is always to be noted that all our statements, including the present ones, are to be understood in the sense of the phenomenological reductions and in eidetic universality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the other hand, there corresponds to each physical thing, and ultimately to the whole world of physical things with one space and one time, the multiplicity of possible noetic occurrences, the possible mental processes of single individuals and communal individuals related to them — mental processes which, as parallels to the previously considered noematic multiplicities, have in their essence itself the peculiarity of relating themselves to this world of physical things according to sense and positum. There thus appear in them the multiplicities of hyletic Data in question, with the relevant &quot;con</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> struingsj positional act-characteristics, etc., which, in their connected unity, make up precisely what we call </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">experimential consciousness</span><span class="font17"> of physical thingness. The unity of the physical thing stands over against an ideally infinite multiplicity of noetic mental processes of a wholly determined essential content and which can be surveyed despite the infinity, all of them united by being consciousness of the &quot;same thing.&quot; This unification becomes given in the sphere of consciousness itself, in mental processes which, on their side, also belong again to the group which we have delimited here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For the restriction to experiential consciousness was meant only as an example, likewise that to the &quot;'physical thing&quot; belonging to the</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">280</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">&quot;world.&quot; Each and everything is eidetically prescribed no matter how far we stretch the framework &lt;of inquiry&gt;, no matter on which level of universality and particularity we also move ——be it even &lt;on the level of&gt; the lowest concretions. As the sphere of mental processes is rigorously conformable to law according to its transcendental essential structure, so that possible essential formation according to noesis and noema is firmly determined in it, just as any possible figure to be inscribed in space is determined by the essence of space according to unconditionally valid laws. What is called possibility (eidetic existence) in both cases is, therefore, absolutely necessary possibility, an absolutely firm member in an absolutely firm framework of an eidetic system. &lt;To achieve</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">scientific cognition is its goal, i.e., to theoretically stamp and control it &lt;so that it becomes&gt; a system of</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">concepts and statements of laws which have their source in the pure intuition of essences. All fundamental differentiations, which make formal ontology and the theory of categories accruing to it the theory of the distribution of regions ofbeing and their categories ofbeing, as well as the constitution of material ontologies appropriate to them </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">are, as will be understood in particular details in further steps, principal headings for phenomenological investigations. Necessarily corresponding to them are the noetic-noematic essential connections which must allow ofbeing systematically described and determined with respect to possibilities and necessities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we examine more precisely what the essential connections between object and consciousness characterized in the present consideration signify and must signify, we are made to feel an ambiguity, and in following it up we notice that we stand at a major turning point in our investigations. We assign to an object a multiplicity of &quot;posita&quot; and of mental processes of a certain noematic content and, more particularly, in such a way that syntheses of identification become a priori possible through them by virtue of which the object can and must be presented as the same. There is necessarily consciousness of the X as the same in the different acts or act-noemas furnished with differing &quot;determination-contents.&quot; But </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is it actually the same?</span><span class="font17"> And </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is the object itself<sup>i(,</sup>actual&quot;?</span><span class="font17"> Can it not be non-actual while the manifoldly harmonious and even intuitionally fulfilled posita — posita of any essence-content whatever — still flow off in the way peculiar to consciousness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We are not interested in the factualities of consciousness and its processes; rather we are interested instead in the problems of essence </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">281</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">which might be formulated here. Consciousness, or the consciousness-subject </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">itse\£Judges</span><span class="font17"> about actuality, asks about it, deems it likely, doubts it, resolves the doubt and thereby effects the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;legitimations of reason.&quot;</span><span class="font17"> Must not the essence of this legitimacy and, correlatively, the essence of &quot;actuality&quot; — related to all kinds of objects according to all formal and regional categories — be allowed to become clear in the essential context of transcendental consciousness, thus purely phenomenologically?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There was, therefore, an ambiguity in our speaking of the noetic-noematic &quot;constitution&quot; of objectivities, e.g., physical thing-objectivities. Pre-eminently in every case we thought of &quot;actual&quot; objects, of physical things belonging to the &quot;actual world” or at least of &quot;an&quot; actual world taken universally. But, then, what does &quot;actual&quot; signify</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">for objects which, in the manner peculiar to consciousness, are still only given through sense and posita? What does it signify for these posita themselves, for the essential sorts of these noemas and of the parallel noeses? What does it signify for the particular modes of their structure according to form and fullness? How is this structure particularized according to the particular object-regions? The question is, thus, how, noetically and noematically, in phenomenological scientificalncss, all the concatenations of consciousness are to be described which make necessary, precisely in its actuality, an object simpliciter (which, in the sense of ordinary speech, always signifies an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actual</span><span class="font17"> object). In the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">broader</span><span class="font17"> sense, however, the object is <sup>4t</sup>constitut-ed&quot; — &quot;whether or not it is actual&quot; — in certain concatenations of consciousness which in themselves bear a discernible unity in so far as they, by virtue of their essence, carry with themselves the consciousness of an identical X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As a matter offact, what has been worked out does not concernjust actualities in some pregnant sense or other. Questions about actuality enter into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> cognitions as cognitions, even in our phenomenological cognitions bearing upon the possible constitution of objects: they all have, indeed, their correlates in &quot;objects&quot; which are meant as &quot;actually existing/<sup>5</sup> When, it may everywhere be asked, is the noematically &quot;intended-to&quot;</span><span class="font7">「'及，机反加</span><span class="font17">es'</span><span class="font7">】 </span><span class="font17">identity of X <sup>4t</sup>ac-tually'' the identity &lt;of X&gt; instead of the &quot;merely&quot; intended-to &lt;identity&gt;? And what does this &quot;merely intended-to&quot; everywhere signify?<sup>30</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We must, therefore, devote new considerations to the problems of actuality and to the correlative ones of rational consciousness which in itself legitimates &lt;that actuality&gt;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">PHENOMENOLOGY OF REASON</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If one speaks simply of objects, one normally means actual, truly existing objects belonging to the particular category of being. No matter what one says about such objects, that which is meant and stated must — if one speaks rationally — be something which can be </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">grounded^</span><span class="font17"> ''shown,<sup>,?</sup> directly </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'&quot;seen&quot;</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mediately &quot;seen intellectually</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the logical sphere, in the sphere of statement, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^being truly&quot; or ^actually&quot; and &quot;being something which can be shown rationally&quot; are necessarily correlated.</span><span class="font17"> This holds, moreover, for all modalities ofbeing, all doxic positional modalities. Obviously the possibility of the rational showing referred to here should be understood, not as empirical, but as &quot;ideal,'' as an essential possibility.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§136 . The First Fundamental Form of Rational Consciousness: Originarily Presentive &quot;Seeing.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">If we now ask what rational showing signifies, that is, of what </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">rational consciousness</span><span class="font17"> consists, the intuitive presentiation of examples and the beginnings of eidetic analysis performed on them offers us at once a number of differences:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">First,</span><span class="font17"> the difference between positing mental processes in which the posited becomes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">given originarily</span><span class="font17"> and those in which it does </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font17">become given in that mode: thus, between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;'perceiving'^ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">ot</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> &quot;seeing&quot; acts —in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> broadest sense</span><span class="font17"> — and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">non- &quot;perceiving' acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus a memorial consciousness — for example, of a landscape — is not originarily presentive; the landscape is not perceived as it would be in case we actually saw it. By this we do not mean to say that memorial consciousness has no competence of its own: only that it is not a &quot;seeing&quot; consciousness. Phenomenology brings to light an analogue of this contrast in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">each of the other kinds of positing</span><span class="font17"> mental</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">processes. For example: We can assert &quot;blindly&quot; that two plus one is equal to one plus two; but we can also make the same judgment in the manner peculiar to intellectual seeing. When we do this, the pre-dicatively formed affair-complex, the synthetical objectivity corresponding to the judgment-synthesis, is given originarily, seized upon in an originary manner. It is no longer given originarily </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font17"> effecting the actual </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[lebendigeri]</span><span class="font17"> intellectual seeing which becomes forthwith an obscured retentional modification. Even though this may have a rational superiority to just any obscure or confused consciousness &lt;283&gt; with the same noematic sense — for example, an ''unthinking<sup>55 </sup>reproduction of something learned and, perhaps, intellectually seen on an earlier occasion — it is not an originarily presentive consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">These differences do not concern the pure sense or the pure positum, since in both members of any such exemplary pair this is identical and also can always be intentively seen as identical. The difference concerns </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the mode in which the bare sense or the bare positum — </span><span class="font17">which, as merely an abstract moment in the concrete noema of consciousness, requires complementary moments ——</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is or is not </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> fulfilled sense or positum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A fullness of the sense does not make all the difference; the How of the fulfilledness matters as well. One mode of consciousness pertaining to the sense is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>Q&lt;,</sup>intuitive&quot;</span><span class="font17"> mode, which is such that the &quot;meant object as meant<sup>55</sup> is intentively intuited; and an especially preeminent case here is the one in which the mode ofintuition is precisely the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originarily presentive</span><span class="font17"> mode. In the perception of the landscape the sense is fulfilled perceptually; in the mode of &quot;itself in person<sup>5 5</sup> there is consciousness of the perceived object with its colors, forms, and other determinations (in so far as they &quot;are included in the perception<sup>55</sup>). Similar pre-eminent cases are found in every act-sphere. Again the situation is one which is two-sided in the sense of a parallelism; it is noetic and noematic. Focusing on the noema we find, fused with the pure sense, the characteristic &quot;in person<sup>55</sup> (as originary fulfilledness); and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the sense, with this characteristic, now functions as the basis for the noematic posited characteristic</span><span class="font17"> or, this being the same thing here: the being-characteristic. We find the parallel to this in focusing on the noesis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">But the posited characteristic has as its own </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> specific rational character,</span><span class="font17"> as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">distinguishing mark</span><span class="font17"> accruing to it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essentially, if and only</span><span class="font17"> /it is a position on the basis of a fulfilled, originarily presentive sense and not merely on the basis of just any sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Here, and in the case of any other kind of rational consciousness, the word &quot;belong&quot; takes on a peculiar signification. For example:<sup>1 </sup>Position </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">belongs</span><span class="font17"> to any appearing &quot;in person&quot; on the part of a physical thing; it is not just somehow one with the appearing (perhaps even as merely a universal fact — this being out of the question here); it is one with it in a peculiar manner: it is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;motivated&quot;</span><span class="font17"> by &lt;the appearing</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">and </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">284</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">again, not just somehow, but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^rationally motivatedy</span><span class="font17"> That is to say, position has its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">original legittmidng basis</span><span class="font17"> in originary givenness. With other modes of givenness legitimizing bases need not be lacking; lacking, however, is the superiority of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">original</span><span class="font17"> basis which plays its pre-eminent role in the relative estimating of other legitimizing bases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In just the same manner, the position of the essence of pre-dicatively formed essence-complex given &quot;originarily&quot; in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">seeing of essences</span><span class="font17"> &quot;belongs&quot; to the position-&quot;material'' &lt;of the essence or pre-dicatively formed essence-complex</span><span class="font7">〉，</span><span class="font17">to the &quot;sense&quot; in its mode of givenness. It is rational and as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">certainty of believing</span><span class="font17"> it is an originally motivated position; it has the specific character of an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;intellectually seeing</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">，</span><span class="font17">position. If the position is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">blind,</span><span class="font17"> if the verbal significations are effected on the basis of an obscure and confusedly intentive act-substratum, then the rational character belonging to intellectual seeing is necessarily lacking; that character is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essentially incompatible </span><span class="font17">with obscure givenness of the predicatively formed affair-complex (if the word givenness is still to be used here) or with such a noematic outfitting of the sense-core. On the other hand, this does not exclude a secondary rational character, as is shown by the example of an imperfect re-presentiating of eidetic cognitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Intellectual seeing, evidence of any kind, is thus a wholly distinguishing occurrence; in terms of its &quot;core&quot; it is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unity</span><span class="font7"> 炉</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">a rational position with that which essentially motivates the position</span><span class="font17"> — this whole situation being understandable as noetic and also as noematic. The word motivation is particularly suited to the relation between the (noetic) positing and the noematic positum in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its mode offulfilledness. </span><span class="font17">The expression, ''evident positum,&quot; is, in its noematic signification, immediately understandable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The double sense of the word evidence, in its application, sometimes to noetic characteristics or to full acts (for example, evidence of</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">judging) and sometimes to noematic posita (for example, evident logical judgment, evident predicative proposition), is a case of the universal and necessary double significancies of expression relating to moments of the correlation between noesis and noema. Phenomenological demonstration of their source makes these double significancies harmless and, indeed, makes it possible to recognize their indispensability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We should note furthermore that the word fulfillment has another double sense which lies in a quite different dimension. Sometimes it signifies </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;'fulfillment df the intention^</span><span class="font17"> as a characteristic which the actual </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positum</span><span class="font17"> takes on by virtue of the particular mode of the sense; sometimes it signifies precisely the peculiarity of this mode itself or</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">285</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">the peculiarity of the sense in question, as including<sup>2</sup> a&quot;Rlling'' which motivates rationally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">The pairs of examples used above illustrate a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">third</span><span class="font17"> difference.<sup>3</sup> What we usually call evidence and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intellectual sight (or intellectual seeing)</span><span class="font17"> is a positional, doxic and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">adequately</span><span class="font17"> presentive consciousness which &quot;excludes being otherwise;'' the positing is motivated in a quite exceptional manner by the adequate givenness and is, in the highest sense, an act of &quot;reason.&quot; The arithmetical example illustrates that for us. In the example of the landscape we have, it is true, a seeing, but not an evidence in the usual pregnant sense of the word, an &quot;intellectual seeing.&quot; Observing more precisely, we note two differences. In the one example it is a matter of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essences;</span><span class="font17"> in the other, a matter of something </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">individual;</span><span class="font17"> secondly, in the eidetic example the originary givenness is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">adequate,</span><span class="font17"> whereas in the example from the sphere of experience it is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">inadequate.</span><span class="font17"> The two differences, which cross one another under some circumstances, will prove to be significant with respect to the kind of evidence.<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With regard to the first difference, it is phenomenologically observable that, so to speak, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^assertoric&quot; seeing of something individual^ </span><span class="font17">for example, the &quot;attentive perceiving&quot; of a physical thing or of an individual affair-complex, differs essentially in its rational character not only from an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;apodictic&quot; seeing,from the intellectual seeing of an essence or of a predicatively f</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">rrmed essence-complex^</span><span class="font17"> but it also differs from the modification of this intellectual seeing which may come about through mixture of the two, namely in the case where something seen intellectually is applied to something seen assertorically and in any case of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">knowing the necessity of the being-thus</span><span class="font17"> of a posited single particular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Evidence and intellectual seeing, in the usual pregnant sense, are understood as signifying the same thing: apodictic intellectual seeing. We propose to separate the two in our terminology. We need a more universal term which encompasses in its signification both assertoric seeing and apodictic intellectual seeing. It should be regarded as a phenomenological cognition of the greatest importance that the two belong to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> essential genus and that, comprehended more universally, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any rational consciousness whatever</span><span class="font17"> is a highest &lt;286&gt; genus of positional modalities within which the &quot;seeing&quot; (in the extremely broadened sense) related to originary givenness is precisely a rigidly delimited species. Now in order to name the highest genus one has the choice between extending either the signification of the term &quot;seeing&quot; (as has just been done, but going very much further) or that of the terms &quot;intellectual insight&quot; and &quot;evidence.&quot; It seems best to choose the term </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">evidence</span><span class="font17"> for the most universal concept; then, for every rational position characterized by a motivational relation to originariness of givenness, the expression </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originary evidence </span><span class="font17">would be available. Furthermore, a distinction should be made between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">assertoric</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">apodictic evidence;</span><span class="font17"> and the term </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intellectual seeing </span><span class="font17">should be used, as before, to designate this </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">apodicticity.</span><span class="font17"> Going still further, one should contrast </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure</span><span class="font17"> intellectual seeing and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">impure</span><span class="font17"> intellectual seeing (for example, cognition of the necessity pertaining to something factual, the being of which need not itselfbe evident) and likewise, quite universally,/?^ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">and impure evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">evidence: 1) something individual evident as the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">consequence</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the positing </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">\Setzung]</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> of something else individual. &lt;2&gt; Extension of predicatively formed eidetic complexes to </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">given </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">cases.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Yet other differences result if one inquires more deeply — differences in the motivating foundations which affect the evidencecharacteristic. For example, the difference between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">purely formal </span><span class="font17">(&quot;analytic,&quot; &quot;logical&quot;) and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">material</span><span class="font17"> (synthetic a priori) evidence. Here, however, we must not go beyond the first indications.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§138. Adequate and Inadequate Evidence.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Let us return to the second distinction concerning evidence indicated above, with which the distinction between adequate and inadequate givenness is connected and which, at the same time, provides us with the occasion for describing a distinctive type of &quot;impure&quot; evidence. The positing of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">physical thing</span><span class="font17"> on the ground of the appearance &quot;itself in person&quot; is, to be sure, a rational positing, but the appearance is always only a one-sided, <sup>t^</sup>imperfect^^ appearance; intended to as &quot;itself in person,&quot; what &quot;properly&quot; appears is not only there, but simply this physical thing itselg the whole in conformity with the total sense, though only one-sidedly intuited and, moreover, multifariously indeterminate. What &quot;properly&quot; appears cannot be separated from the physical thing as, let us say, a physical thing for itself; in the full sense of the physical thing, the sense-correlate &lt;of what &quot;properly&quot; appears</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">fashions a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">non-selfsufficient</span><span class="font17"> part which can only have unity and selfsufficiency of sense in a whole which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessarily </span><span class="font17">includes in itself empty components and indeterminate components.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Of essential necessity something physically real, a being with that sense, appears only </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^inadequately^</span><span class="font17"> in a closed appearance. Essentially tied up with this is the fact that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">no</span><span class="font17"> rational positing which </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">rests upon</span><span class="font7"> 〈</span><span class="font17">287</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">that sort of inadequately presentive appearance</span><span class="font17"> can be </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^ultimately valid,&quot; </span><span class="font17">&quot;insurmountable;&quot; and that no &lt;rational positing&gt; is equivalent in its singularization to the &lt;positing&gt; simpliciter: &quot;The physical thing is actual;'' it is only Equivalent to the positing: &quot;it is actual&quot; — assuming that the further course of experience does not bring forth ^stronger rational motives^^ which show the original positing as a positing to be &quot;cancelled out&quot; in the broader context. Accordingly, the positing is only rationally motivated by the appearance (the imperfectly fulfilled perceptual sense) in and for itself considered in its singularization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The phenomenology of reason must therefore study the different occurrences which are a priori predelineated in the sphere of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">modes of being which are necessarily only inadequately presentive </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(transcendencies</span><span class="font17"> in the sense of realities). It must make clear how consciousness of inadequate givenness, how the one-sided appearing, is related to one and the same determinable X in the continuous progress to always new appearances which are continually being blended with one another; which eidetic possibilities result here; how, on the one hand, a continuation of experience is possible and always rationally motivated by continually available rational posit-ings: precisely the course of experience in which the empty places of the previous appearance are filled out, the indeterminacies are more precisely determined and thus always in the manner of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">thoroughgoing harmonious fulfilling with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> steadily increasing rational power,</span><span class="font17"> On the other hand, it must make clear the contrary possibilities, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">cases effusion or polythetical syntheses of discordancy,</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;deteTmination otherwise&quot;'</span><span class="font17"> of the X always intended to as the same </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">otherwise than in the correspondingly original sense-bestowal. Moreover, it must show how positional components pertaining to the earlier perceptual flow suffer </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">cancellation</span><span class="font17"> together with their sense; how, under circumstances, the whole perception, so to speak, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">explodes</span><span class="font17"> and splits up into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup>'conflicting physical thing-apprehensions'<sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font17">into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">suppositions</span><span class="font17"> concerning physical things; how the positings of these suppositions are annulled and uniquely modified in this annulment; or else how the one positing, remaining unmodified, &quot;conditions” the cancellation of the &quot;counter positing;<sup>55</sup> and similar processes of the same kind.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;288&gt; To be studied in still more detail are the relevant modifications which the original rational positings undergo such that they incur a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positive phenomenological increase</span><span class="font17"> with respect to their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">motivating &quot;foTcd</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">，</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font17">in the further course of harmonious fulfillment, such that they continually acquire a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^weight^</span><span class="font17"> always and essentially have a weight, to be sure, but one which differs </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">by degrees,</span><span class="font17"> There are, moreover, the other possibilities to be analyzed: how the weight of positings is affected by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^counter</span><span class="font7"> 机</span><span class="font17">oZzles,” how, in the case of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doubt,</span><span class="font17"> they are mutually </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;held in balance</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> how a positing in competition with one of &quot;greater&quot; weight is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^overcome^ &quot;'abandoned^</span><span class="font17"> etc.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">In addition, naturally, it is necessary to subject to a comprehensive eidetic analysis the processes in the sense, as the appertinent </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">position-</span><span class="font7">机〃％&quot;〃/$, </span><span class="font17">which are essentially determinative for alterations in the posited characteristics (e.g., the processes of &quot;conflict'' or ''rivalry'' of appearances). For here, as everywhere, in the phenomenological sphere there are neither accidents nor facticities: everything is motivated by essential determination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the same manner </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">an inquiry into the essence cf all kinds of immediate rational acts</span><span class="font17"> is to be carried out in the context of a universal phenomenology of noetic and noematic data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">To every region and category</span><span class="font17"> of alleged objects there corresponds phenomenologically not only a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fundamental sort of sense,</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">oiposita,</span><span class="font17"> but also a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fundamental type oj originarily presentive consciousness</span><span class="font17"> of such senses and, belonging to it, a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fundamental type of originary evidence</span><span class="font17"> which is essentially motivated by originary givenness of such a character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Every such evidence — understanding the term in our broadened sense ——is either </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">adequate</span><span class="font17"> evidence, of essential necessity incapable of being further &quot;strengthened&quot; or &quot;weakened,” thus </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">without degrees of weight]</span><span class="font17"> or the evidence is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">inadequate</span><span class="font17"> and thus </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">capable of being increased and decreased.</span><span class="font17"> Whether or not this or that evidence is possible in a given sphere depends on its generic type. It is therefore a priori prefigured, and it is countersense to demand in one sphere the perfection belonging to the evidence of another sphere (e.g. that of eidetic relationships) which essentially excludes it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It must still be noted that the original signification of the concepts of &quot;adequate&quot; and &quot;inadequate&quot; related to modes of givenness had &lt;289&gt; to be extended to the essential peculiarities pertaining to the rational positings themselves which are founded by them precisely by virtue of this nexus — one of those unavoidable equivocations by extension &lt;and&gt; which is harmless as long as one recognizes it as such by being fully aware of the distinction between the original and the derived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§ 139. The Interweaving of All Kinds of Reason. Theoretical. Axiological and Practical Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">According to what has been explained so far, a positing of no matter what quality has4ts legitimacy as a positing of its sense when it is rational; the rational characteristic is precisely itself the characteristic oflegitimation which &quot;beRts&quot; it essentially and, therefore, not as an accidental fact among accidental circumstances pertaining to a factually positing Ego. Correlatively, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the positum</span><span class="font17"> is also said to be legitimated: it is present in rational consciousness, furnished with its noematic legitimacy-characteristic which, again, essentially belongs to the positum as the noematic position qualified in this or that way, and of this or that sense-material. More precisely stated: there belongs to it a fullness of such a character which, on its side, grounds the rational distinctiveness of the position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Here the positum has its legitimacy in itself. But it can also be that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;something speaks on behalf of the positum^</span><span class="font17"> that it can still have a share in reason without &quot;itsef being rational. In order to remain within the doxic sphere, let us recall the relevant connection of the doxic modalities with the protodoxa<sup>6</sup> to which everything refers back. IR on the other hand, we consider the rational characteristics belonging to these modalities, then at the outset the thought thrusts itself to the fore that all of them, no matter how different they may otherwise be with respect to materials and motivational foundations, refer back, so to speak, to a primal rational character belonging to the domain of primal belief back to the case of originary and ultimately perfect evidence. It is noteworthy that profound concatenations of essences obtain between these two kinds of retroreference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Just to indicate the following: in itself, something deemed likely can be characterized as rational. If we follow the reference, inherent in it, back to the corresponding primal believing, and if we adopt this believing in the form of a &quot;supposing,&quot; then ''something speaks for it.&quot; It is not the belief itself, simpliciter, which is characterized as rational, although it has a share in reason. We see that further </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">290</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">rational-theoretical distinctions and inquiries related to them are needed here. Concatenations of essences are made prominent between the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">different</span><span class="font17"> qualities with the rational characteristics peculiar to them and, more particularly, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reciprocal</span><span class="font17"> concatenations; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^nd^finally, all lines run back to &quot;mal believings and their primal reason;</span><span class="font17"> that is to say, to primal truth, or to </span><span class="font7">&quot;尸〃肌''</span><span class="font17">&lt;in an absolute sense&gt;.<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Truth is manifestly the correlate of the perfect rational characteristics pertaining to protodoxa, to certainty of belief. The expression, ''something posited protodoxically, for instance a predicative proposition, is true,&quot; and then the expression, ''perfect rational characteristics accrue to the corresponding<sup>8</sup> believing, judging&quot;— are equivalent correlates. Naturally nothing is said about the fact of a mental process and about the one whojudges, although it is eidetical-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ly unquestionable that truth can only be actually given in an actual evidential consciousness; and this holds for the truth of the unquestionableness itself, the truth of the equivalence just indicated, and so forth. If the protodoxic evidence, that of certainty ofbelief, is lacking to us, then for its sense-content, '<sup>S</sup>S is pj we say, a doxic modality can be evident — for example, the presumed likelihood, <sup>&lt;S</sup>S ought to be p.‘‘ This modal evidence is manifestly equivalent to and necessarily connected with a protodoxic evidence of an altered sense, i.e., with the evidence or with the primal truth: &quot;That S is p is likely (probable);'' on the other hand, &lt;the modal evidence is also connected&gt; with the truth: &quot;Something speaks for S being p;'' and, again: ''Something speaks for Sp being true;'' and so forth. With all this eidetic connections are indicated which require phenomenological inquiries into their origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But evidence is by no means a mere name for those sorts of rational processes in the sphere of belief (and even less in the sphere of the predicative judgment); it is rather a name for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all positional spheres</span><span class="font17"> and, in particular, also for the significant rational relationships obtaining </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">between</span><span class="font17"> them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It therefore involves the highly difficult and far-reaching groups of problems of reason in the sphere of emotional and volitional posit-ings<sup>9</sup> as well as their interwovenness with the &quot;theoretical,'' i.e., doxic, reason. The &quot;theoretical&quot; or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^doxological truths</span><span class="font17"> or </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">evidence,</span><span class="font17"> has its parallel in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^axiological and practical truths or evidence&quot;</span><span class="font17"> whereby the latter &quot;truths&quot; are given expression and cognized in doxological</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">291</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">truths, that is to say, in specifically logical (apophantical) ones.<sup>10</sup> It need not be said that to deal with these problems there must be fundamental investigations of the sort which we tried to embark upon above: investigations involving the eidetic relationships which connect the doxic positings with all other kinds of positings, those of the emotions and the will and, again, those which lead all doxic modalities back to the protodoxa. Precisely by such investigations it is made understandable on the basis of ultimate grounds why the certainty of belief and, correspondingly, the doxological and ul-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">timately the primal truth play such a dominant role in all of reason — a role which, at the same time, also makes it obvious that, with respect to their solution, the problems of reason in the doxic sphere must take precedence over those of axiological and practical reason.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§140 . Corifirmation. Justification Without Evidence. Equivalence of Positional and Neutral Intellectual Sight.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Further studies are required concerning the problems presented to us by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">combinations of ^coincidence&quot;'</span><span class="font17"> which (to mention but one distinctive case), in accord with their essence, are to be established </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">between acts &quot;&nbsp;the same sense and positum, but of different rational values.</span><span class="font17"> For example, an evidential act and a non-evidential act can coincide, as a consequence of which, in the transition from the latter to the former, the former acquires the characteristic of a validating act, whereas the latter, &lt;the non-evidential act,&gt; acquires the characteristic of an act which is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">being</span><span class="font17"> validated. The positing with intellectual seeing of the one functions as &quot;confirmatory'' for the positing without intellectual seeing of the other. The &quot;positum&quot; is &quot;verified'' or even &quot;confirmed,<sup>55</sup> the imperfect modes of givenness are converted into perfect ones. How the process looks, and can look, is predelineated by the essence of the kinds of positing in question, or else by the essence of the posita in the particular case in their fulfillment. For every genus of posita the forms of essentially possible verification must be made clear phenomenologically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If the positing is not non-rational, then motivated possibilities are to be drawn from its essence showing that and how the positing can become converted into an actual rational positing which verifies it. It is to be intellectually seen, in this connection, that not every imperfect evidence prescribes a course of fulfillment which terminates in a </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">292</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">corresponding</span><span class="font17"> originary evidence, in an evidence of the same sense; on the contrary, such an originary verification, so to speak, is necessarily excluded by certain sorts of evidence. That holds, e.g., for retrospective memory and, in a certain way, for any remembering whatever, and likewise essentially for empathy to which we shall assign, in the &lt;Second&gt; Book, a fundamental kind of evidence (and which we shall investigate there in greater detail). In any case, we have designated very important phenomenological themes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Yet to be observed is that the motivated possibility, of which we</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">spoke above, is to be sharply distinguished from empty possibility:<sup>11 </sup>it is motivationally determined by that which the positum includes in itself given such as it is fulfilled. It is an empty possibility that the now unseen underside of this desk here has ten legs instead of four, which is actually the case. In contrast, the number four is a motivated possibility for the determinate perception which I am in the process of effecting. For any perception whatever it is a motivated possibility that, in certain ways, perceptual <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>circumstances^^ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font17"> change, that &quot;as a consequence&quot; in corresponding modes the perception </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can </span><span class="font17">change into a series of perceptions of determinate kinds predelineated by the sense of my perception and which fulfills it and confirms its positing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For the rest, with respect to &quot;empty&quot; or &quot;mere&quot; possibility of validation two further cases are to be distinguished: Either the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">possibility coincides with actuality,</span><span class="font17"> that is to say, such that the intellectual seeing of the possibility eo ipso carries with it consciousness of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originary </span><span class="font17">givenness and consciousness of reason; or, however, that is not the case. The latter obtains in the examplejust used. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Actual experience,</span><span class="font17"> and not merely a running through in presentation of &quot;possible&quot; perceptions, provides an actual </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">validation of positings bearing upon something real,</span><span class="font17"> let us say, validation of the positing of the factual existence of events belonging to Nature. In contrast, in any case of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positing of an essence,</span><span class="font17"> or else of a positum pertaining to an essence, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intuitive presentiation of its perfectfulfillment is equivalent to the fulfillment itself, just </span><span class="font17">as a priori the intuitive presentiation, indeed the mere phantasy, of an eidetic concatenation is &quot;equivalent&quot; to the intellectual seeing of that concatenation, i.e., the one changes into the other by means of a mere alteration of attitude; and the possibility of this reciprocal conversion is an essentially necessary, rather than accidental, one.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§141 . Immediate and Mediate Rational Positing. Mediate Evidence.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">As we know, all mediate grounding leads back to immediate grounding. With respect to all object-provinces and positings related to them, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">primal source of all legitimacy</span><span class="font17"> lies in immediate evidence and, more narrowly delimited, in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originary evidence^</span><span class="font17"> or in the originary givenness motivating it. But in different ways one can indirectly draw upon this source, deriving from it the rational value of a positing which, in itself is not an evidence, or if the positing is immediate, confirming and corroborating it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us consider the last case. In an example let us indicate the difficult problems which are involved in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">relationship of non-evidential, immediate rational positing to originary evidence</span><span class="font17"> (in our sense related to the originarity of givenness).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">certain</span><span class="font17"> mode, any clear </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">memory</span><span class="font17"> has original, immediate legitimacy: considered in and for itself, it &quot;weighs&quot; something, no matter how much or how little; it has a &quot;weight.&quot; But it only has a relative and imperfect legitimacy. With respect to what memory present-iates, a past event, let us say, there is inherent in it a relationship to the actual present. It posits the past event and along with it necessarily posits a horizon, even though in a vague, dark and indeterminate way; made clear and positionally distinct, it must allow of being made explicit in a complex of positionally effected memories which would terminate </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in actual perceptions^ in the actual hie et nunc.</span><span class="font17"> This holds for memories of whatever sort in our </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">broadest</span><span class="font17"> sense related to all temporal modes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In such posita, intellectual seeings of essences are unmistakably enounced. They point to interconnections of essences with the val-</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">294</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">idation of which the sense and the kind of verification, of which each memory is capable and &quot;in need,^^ would be clarified. With every advance from memory to memory into the concatenation of memories being made distinct, memory is confirmed. To a certain extent the confirmation is a reciprocal one, the weights of the memories are functionally dependent on one another; each memory in the concatenation<sup>12</sup> has a growing force with the amplification of the concatenation —— a force greater than they would have in a narrower concatenation or in isolation. I£ however, the explication is carried</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">out to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actual now, then something of the light ofperception and its evidence shines back upon the whole series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One can even say: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in hiddenness the rationality, the characteristic ^ legitima</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">y, of memory springs</span><span class="font17"> from the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">power of perception,</span><span class="font17"> effective throughout all confusion and darkness even if the perception is &quot;not in effect.<sup>,5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In any case, however, it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">needs</span><span class="font17"> such verification so that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font17"> properly bears the mediate reflection of perceptual legitimacy may clearly emerge. Memory has its own </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">kind cf inadequacy</span><span class="font17"> in that what is not remembered can be confused with what is &quot;actually&quot; remembered, or in that different memories transpire and can pass for the unity of one memory; whereas in the unfolding of its horizon being actualized, the relevant series of memories are separated and in such a way that the unitary memory-image &quot;explodes,&quot; becoming dispersed into a plurality of mutually incompatible memorial intuitions: as a result, there would be processes to describe similar to those which we had occasion to indicate for perception (manifestly in a way very much more capable of universalization).<sup>13</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">All of this serves as an indication by example of great and important groups of problems pertaining to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>Qi</sup> confirmation&quot;' and<sup>c</sup>'verification^ of immediate rational positings</span><span class="font17"> (as well as to illustrate the division of rational positings into pure and impure, unmixed and mixed positings); but, above all, here we seize upon </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> sense in which it is valid to say that all mediate rational positing and, in further consequence, all predicative and conceptual rational cognizing, leads back to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">evidence.</span><span class="font17"> Properly understood, only originary evidence is the</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">295</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">source of legitimation &quot;originaliter&quot; and, e.g., the rational positing pertaining to memory and thus to all reproductive acts, even including empathy, is not original and is, in a certain manner, &quot;derived.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, there are quite different forms to be drawn from the source of originary givenness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One such form has already been indicated on occasion: the weakening of rational values in the continual transition from living evidence to non-evidence. But now an essentially different group of cases may be referred to, where a positum is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mediately</span><span class="font17"> related to immediately evident grounds in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">synthetical complex</span><span class="font17"> which is evident at every step. As a consequence, there arises a new universal type of rational positings phenomenologically different in rational charac-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">teristics from immediate evidence. We therefore also have here a kind of derived, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;mediate evidence&quot;</span><span class="font17"> — the kind usually aimed at exclusively by the expression,</span><span class="font7">〈&quot;</span><span class="font17">mediate evidence.''</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">In accord with its essence, this derived characteristic of evidence can only appear in the final member of a concatenation of positings which begins with immediate evidences, goes on in differing forms and in all further steps is borne by evidences; whereby these evidences are in part immediate, in part already derived; in part intellectually seen, in part not, originary or non-originary. As a result, a new field of the phenomenological theory of reason is designated. The task here is to study in noetic and noematic respect the generical as well as the specific eidetic processes pertaining to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">reason in mediate groundings<sub>y</sub> validatings</span><span class="font17"> of every kind and form and in all positional spheres; to trace back to their phenomenological origins the different &quot;principles&quot; of such validating which, e.g., are of essentially different kinds depending in each case on whether or not it is a matter of objectivities given as immanental or transcendent, adequate or inadequate; and, on this basis, in retrospect of all the phenomenological strata involved, to make these ''principles'' intelligible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§142 . Rational Positing and Being.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Along with the universal awareness of reason, which is the aim of the groups of investigations indicated — reason in the widest sense extended to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all species cf positings</span><span class="font17"> as well as to the axiological and practical positings — there must be acquired eo ipso the universal clarification of the eidetic correlations combining the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">idea of true being </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">296</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">with the ideas: Truth, Reason, Consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Accordingly, a generical intellectual sight is soon yielded, namely that not merely &quot;truly existing object^^ and &quot;object to be rationally posited&quot; are equivalent correlates, but also that &quot;truly existing object^^ and object to be posited in an originally perfect rational positing are equivalent. The object would not be given to the rational positing imperfectly, merely &quot;one sidedly.^^ The sense underlying it as material for the determinable X would not leave anything &quot;open&quot; with respect to any apprehensionally predesignated sides: no determinableness which would not be established determinateness, no sense which would not be fully determined, delimited. Since the rational positing should be a positing originaliter, it must have its</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">rational ground in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originary givenness</span><span class="font17"> in the full sense of what is determined: The X is not only meant in full determinedness, but is given originarily precisely in this determinedness. The equivalence indicated now signifies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Of essential necessity (in the Apriori of unconditioned eidetic universality), </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">to every <sup>Ci</sup>truly existing&quot;' object</span><span class="font17"> there corresponds </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the idea of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">possible consciousness</span><span class="font17"> in which the object itselfis seized upon </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originarily </span><span class="font17">and therefore in a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">perfectly adequate</span><span class="font17"> way. Conversely, if this possibility is guaranteed, then eo ipso the object truly exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Particularly significant here is the following: In the essence of every </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">apprehensional category</span><span class="font17"> (which is the correlate of every objectcategory) there is determinately predesignated which formations of concrete, perfect or imperfect, apprehensions of objects pertaining to such categories are possible. Moreover, it is essentially predesignated for each imperfect apprehension how it is to be perfected, how its sense is to be completed, fulfilled by intuition, and how the intuition is to be further enriched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Every object-category (or every region and every category in our narrower, pregnant sense) is a universal essence which of necessity is itself made adequately given. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">In its adequate givenness</span><span class="font17"> it /^escribes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">an intellectually seen generical rule</span><span class="font17"> for every particular object becoming intended to in multiplicities of concrete mental processes (which mental processes here, naturally, are to be taken not as individual singularities but instead as essences, as ultimate concreta). It prescribes the rule for how an object subordinate to it would be fully determined with respect to sense and mode of givenness, how it would be made adequately given in an originary way; it prescribes</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">297</span><span class="font7">〉 </span><span class="font17">by which broken or continually unbroken concatenations of consciousness &lt;the object is given&gt; and which concrete essences are furnished the concatenations. How much is inherent in these brief statements will become comprehensible in the more detailed expositions in the last chapter (from §149 on).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Here a brief indicative example will be sufficient: We know in apodictic evidence that the unseen determinations ofa physical thing are, like any physical thing-determinations whatever, necessarily spatial: this yields a law-conforming rule for the possible modes of spatial completion of the unseen sides of the appearing physical thing; a rule which, fully developed, is called pure geometry. Furthermore, physical thing-determinations are temporal and material ones: there belong to them new rules for possible (thus not</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">arbitrary) sense-completions and, in further consequence, for possible positional intuitions, or appearances. Of which essential contents these can be, under which norms their stuff, their possible noematic (and noetic) apprehensional characteristics, stand, that too is a priori predesignated.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§143 . Adequate Physical Thing-Givenness as Idea in the Kantian Sense.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">But before beginning with those problems, an addition is required to set aside the illusion of a contradiction with our earlier presentation (p. 286). Of essential necessity there are only given, we said, inadequately appearing (thus also only inadequately perceivable) objects. However, we must not overlook the restrictive addendum which we made.

<p><span class="font17">But </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">perfect givenness is nevertheless predesignated as &quot;Idea&quot;</span><span class="font17"> (in the Kantian sense) — as a system which, in its eidetic type, is an absolutely determined system of endless processes of continuous appearings, or as a field of these processes, an a priori determined </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">continuum of appearances</span><span class="font17"> with different, but determined, dimensions, and governed throughout by a fixed set of eidetic laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This continuum is determined more precisely as infinite<sup>14</sup>on all sides, consisting of appearances in all its phases of the same deter-&lt;298&gt; minable X so ordered in its concatenations and so determined with respect to the essential contents that any of its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">lines</span><span class="font17"> yields, in its continuous course, a harmonious concatenation (which itself is to be designated as a unity of mobile appearances) in which the X, given always as one and the same, is more precisely and never &quot;otherwise” continuously-harmoniously determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If, now, a closed unity of the course, thus an act only finitely mobile, is inconceivable by virtue of the all-sided infinity of the continuum (that would yield a countersensical finite infinity): the idea of this continuum and the idea of perfect givenness prefigured by the idea of the continuum is then nevertheless presented in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intellectual</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">The idea of an infinity motivated in conformity with its essence is not itself an infinity; seeing intellectually that this infinity of necessity cannot be given does not exclude, but rather requires, the intellectually seen givenness of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">idea</span><span class="font17"> of this infinity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">It therefore remains as a result that the Eidos, True-Being, is corre-latively equivalent to the Eidos, Adequately-Given and To-Be-Evidentially Positable ——but that either in the sense of finite givenness or givenness in the form of an idea. In the one case, being is &quot;immanental'' being, being as closed mental process or noetic mental process-correlate; in the other case, being is transcendent being, i.e, being, the &quot;transcendence'' of which inheres precisely in the infinity of the noematic correlate which it requires as the “material&quot; of being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When a presentive intuition is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">adequate</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">immanental,</span><span class="font17"> then, to be sure, it is not sense and object which coalesce but, instead, originarily fulfilled sense and object. The object is precisely that which is seized upon, posited, as the originary It Itselfin adequate intuition; it is seen intellectually by virtue of originarity, and by virtue of the sense-completedness and completed originary sense-fulfilledness it is absolutely seen intellectually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When the presentive intuition is one of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">something transcendent to it, </span><span class="font17">then something objective cannot become adequately given; only the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">idea</span><span class="font17"> of that something objective can be given, or else ofits sense and its &quot;epistemic essence,<sup>,J</sup> and consequently there can be given an a priori rule for law-conforming infinities of inadequate experiences.</span></p>

The rule-systems of geometry determine with absolute precision all possible forms of</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">movement which can supplement the observed piece of movement here and now, but it does not distinguish a single actual course of movement of what is actually moving. How can empirical thinking, grounded in experience, be of further help there? How is it possible scientifically to determine physical affairs as unities posited according to experience, yet which include infinitely many significations? How, within the positing of Nature, can the goal of univocal determination be reached ——determination in conformity with the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">idea</span><span class="font17"> of the Object belonging to Nature, of the Event belonging to Nature, and so forth (which is fully determined as the idea of something individually unique)? All these questions pertain to a new level of research. They belong to the phenomenology of specifically experiencing reason and, in particular, to the phenomenology of reason peculiar to physics, psychology and the natural sciences as such, which traces back to their phenomenological sources the ontological and noetic rules belonging to experiential science. But this signifies that it searches out and eidetically explores the phenomenological strata, noetic and noematic, in which the content of these rules are embedded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§ 145. Critical Considerations Concerning the Phenomenology of Evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is clear from considerations carried out that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenology of reason, noetics in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> pregnant sense,</span><span class="font17"> which will undertake an intuitive exploration not just of any consciousness, but of consciousness of reason, everywhere presupposes universal phenomenology. It is itself a phenomenological fact that — in the realm of positionality<sup>15</sup> — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">positing consciousness is ruled by norms in every genus;</span><span class="font17"> the norms are nothing else than eidetic laws which, with respect to their kind and </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">300</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">form, are related to noetic-noematic concatenations to be strictly analyzed and described. In that connection, even </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^non-reason&quot;</span><span class="font17"> is naturally everywhere to be regarded as the negative counterpart of reason, just as the phenomenology of evidence includes its counterpart, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">absuTdi^.'s The universal eidetic theory cf evidence</span><span class="font17"> with its analyses</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">related to the most universal eidetic distinctions fashions a relatively small, though fundamental, piece of the phenomenology of reason. Accordingly, what was briefly maintained at the beginning of this Book<sup>17</sup> against the inverted interpretation of evidence is confirmed —and the deliberations just carried out are sufficient to see that perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Evidence is, in fact, not some sort of consciousness-index attached to ajudgment (and usually one<sup>18</sup> speaks of such evidence only in the case of judgment), calling to us like a mystic voice from a better world: Here is the truth; — as though such a voice would have something to say to free spirits like us and would not have to show its title to legitimacy. We no longer need to argue with skepticism, nor take into consideration objections of the old type which cannot overcome the theory of evidence which resorts to indices and feeling: whether an evil genius (the Cartesian fiction) or a fateful change in the factual course of the world could make it happen that just any false judgment would be outfitted with this index, this feeling of intellectual necessity, of the transcendent oughtness; and the like. If one proceeds to the study of the phenomena themselves which belong here, and does so within the limits of the phenomenological reduction, then one recognizes with fullest clarity that here it is a matter of a relevant mode of positing (thus not of anything so insignificant as some sort of attached content, nor of an appendage of whatever sort) which belongs to the eidetically determined constitutions of the essence of the noema (e.g., the mode of original intellectual seenness belonging to the noematic composition of &quot;originarily&quot; presentive seeing of essences). One then further recognizes that once more the eidetic laws rule the relationship of those positing acts which do not have this distinctive constitution to those which do; that, ^g^? there is something like consciousness of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^fulfillment of the intention</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">；</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font17"> of justification and confirmation specifically related to posited characteristics, just as there are the corresponding </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">counter characteristics</span><span class="font17"> of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">unjustification, disconfirmation.</span><span class="font17"> One further recognizes that the logical principles require a profound pheno-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">menological clarification, and that, e.g., the principle of contradiction leads us back to concatenations of essences of possible verification and possible disconfirmation (or rational cancellation).<sup>19 </sup>Universally, one acquires the intellectual insight that, above all, it is a question here, not of accidental facts, but instead of eidetic processes which stand in their eidetic context, and that, therefore, what takes place in the Eidos functions as an absolutely insurmountable norm for the fact. In this phenomenological chapter one should also make clear that not every positing mental process (e.g., any mental judgment-process you please) cannot become evident in the same manner and, specifically, that not every positing mental process can become immediately evidential; furthermore, that all manners of rational positing, all types of immediate or mediate evidence, are rooted in phenomenological complexes in which the fundamentally different regions of objects are noetically-noematically distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In particular, it is of concern to study systematically the continuous unions of identity and the synthetical identifications in every domain with respect to their phenomenological constitution. Once one has become acquainted — which is the first step needed — with the inner structure of intentive mental processes with respect to all universal structures, the parallelism of these structures, the stratification in the noema such as sense, subject of sense, posited characteristics, fullness: then it is necessary to make fully clear in all cases of synthetical unions how notjust any act-combinations whatever take place, but rather how combination into the unity of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font17"> act takes place. More particularly, how identifying unions are possible, how here and there the determinable X is made to coincide, how, in that &lt;3O2&gt; case, sense-determinations and their empty places — here that signifies their moments of indeterminateness </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">are related; likewise, how fullnesses, how, therefore, the forms of confirmation, of val-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">idation, of progressive cognition, at lower and higher levels of consciousness, become clear and are intellectually seen in analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, these and all parallel studies of reason are carried out in the &quot;transcendental,&quot; in the phenomenological attitude. No judgment which occurs there is a natural judgment presupposing the positing of natural actuality as background, and not even where the phenomenology of the consciousness of actuality, of cognition of Nature, of seeing of values related to Nature and intellectual seeing of values is concerned. Everywhere we investigate the fashionings of noeses and noemata, we project a systematic and eidetic morphology, everywhere bring into relief essential necessities and essential possibilities: the latter as necessary possibilities, forms of unions of compatibility which are prescribed in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essences</span><span class="font17"> and delimited by laws of essences. Everywhere &quot;object&quot; is the name for eidetic concatenations of consciousness; it appears first of all as noematic X, as the subject of sense pertaining to different essential types of sense and posita. Moreover, it appears as the name, &quot;actual object,<sup>M</sup> and is then the name for certain eidetically considered rational concatenations in which the sense-conforming, unitary X inherent in them receives its rational position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Similar names for determined, eidetically delimited groups of consciousness-formations &quot;teleologically&quot; belonging together, to be fixed by the inquiry into essences, are the expressions, ''possible object,<sup>M</sup> &quot;probable,&quot; &quot;dubitable&quot; object; and so forth. The concatenations there are always again other, to be described strictly in their otherness: thus, e.g., it is easily seen intellectually that the possibility of an X determined thus and so<sup>20</sup> is not justified simply by originary givenness of this X in its sense-composition, thus by authentication of actuality, but rather that even merely reproductively founded deemingj&gt;ossible can be reciprocally confirmed in the harmonious coming together; similarly, that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doubtfulness</span><span class="font17"> isjustified in conflicting phenomena between modalized intuitions of certain descriptive sorts; and so forth. As a result, the investigations of the theory of reason are combined which relate to the distinction of materially determinate affairs, values, practical objectivities, and which then investigate the formations produced by consciousness constitutive for them. Phenomenology therefore actually encompasses the whole natural world and all of the ideal worlds which it</span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">303</span><span class="font7">〉</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">excludes: phenomenology encompasses them as the “world sense&quot; by virtue of the sets of eidetic laws connecting any object-sense and noema whatever with the closed system of noeses, and specifically by virtue of the eidetic concatenations of rational positing the correlate of which is the “actual object<sup>,5</sup> which, thus, on its side, always exhibits the index for the whole determined system of teleologically unifying fashionings of consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">CHAPTER THREE</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">THE LEVELS OF UNIVERSALITY PERTAINING TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE THEORY OF REASON</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Previously our meditations on the problems of a phenomenology of reason have moved on the heights of universality which did not bring about the essential ramifications of the problems and their connections with formal and regional ontologies. In this respect we must attempt to be more precise; only in that way will the full sense of the phenomenological eidetics of reason and the whole realm of their problems be disclosed to us.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§146 . The Most Universal Problems.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Let us return to the sources of the problems of reason and follow them in their ramifications in the most systematic way possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Intentionality is the name of the problem encompassed by the whole of phenomenology. The name precisely expresses the fundamental property of consciousness; all phenomenological problems, even the hyletic ones, find a place within it. As a consequence, phenomenology begins with problems of intentionality; but first of all &lt;it begins&gt; in universality and without drawing into its sphere questions about acHrat (true) being intended to in consciousness. We leave out of consideration the fact that positing consciousness with a posited characteristic can be designated in the most universal sense as a &quot;meaning&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">[vermeinen],</span><span class="font17"> and as ’’meaning&quot; it necessarily comes under the rational opposition of validity and invalidity. We only arrived at these problems in the last chapters in retrospect ofthe chief structures of consciousness which, in the meantime, have become understandable. Because it was a matter of eidetic beginnings, we accordingly carried out the analyses in the greatest possible universality. The systematic way goes from higher to lower universality in all eidetic spheres, even if the analyses tracing them out are attached to</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;304&gt; something particular. We spoke of reason and the positing of reason taken universally, of originary and derived, of adequate and inadequate evidence, of intellectually seeing essences and evidence of something; and the like. The descriptions we sketched already presuppose a broad phenomenological basis, a whole series of difficult distinctions which we worked out in the chapters on the most universal structures of consciousness. Without the concepts of sense, positum, fulfilled positum (epistemic essence in the language of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Logische Untersuchungen)</span><span class="font17"> we do not arrive at all at the radical formulation of any problems of the theory of reason. These concepts presuppose, again, other eidetic differentiations corresponding to them: the differences of positionality and neutrality, those of posited characteristics and their materials, the exclusion of the relevant eidetic modifications which do not enter into the Eidos &quot;positum,&quot; such as, e.g., attentional modifications; and so forth. At the same time, in order not to underestimate the range of necessary analyses in the most universal stratum of the theory of reason, of which we speak here, we emphasize that the eidetic descriptions of the last chapters should be accepted as simple beginnings. Just as everywhere else, so here we only follow through on the methodic aim of preparing so much solid ground for each essentially new stratum which should be sketched as a field of phenomenological investigations, such that we can assure ourselves of it, formulate the problems of departure and ground related to it, and freely cast our regard around in the horizon of problems surrounding it.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§147 . Ramifications of the Problem. Formal Logic, Axiology and Theory of Practice.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">The universal phenomenology of reason is ramified when we take into account the further structural differences which are determinative for rational characteristics: when we take account of the differentiations with respect to fundamental kinds of positings, of the difference between positing simpliciter and founded positing, and of the intersecting differences of one membered positings and synthesiz-ings. The chief problem-groups of reason (problems of evidence) are related to the chief genera of positings and the position-materials essentially required by them. Standing in first place are, naturally, proto doxa, the doxic modalities with the modalities of being corresponding to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In pursuing such goals of the theory of reason one necessarily gains the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">rational-theoretical problems of clarifying formal logic</span><span class="font17"> and the parallel &lt;305&gt; disciplines which I have called </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal axiology and theory of practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is necessary, first of all, to refer to the earlier expositions<sup>1 </sup>concerning the theories of the pure forms ofposita and, specifically, of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">synthetical</span><span class="font17"> posit a related to the predicative doxic synthesis as well as to synthetical forms belonging to the doxic modalities, moreover to emotional and conative acts. (Thus, e.g., the forms of preference, of valuing and willing “fbr the sake of another,<sup>55</sup> the forms of the axiological <sup>u</sup> and<sup>5 5</sup> and the &quot;or&quot;.) In these theories of form we speak noematically of synthetical posit a with respect to their pure form without raising the question of the validity or non-validity of reason. Therefore they still do not belong to the stratum of the theory of reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, as soon as we raise these questions and, more particularly, for any posita whatever in so far as they are conceived as determined exclusively by the pure forms, we find ourselves in formal logic and in the above mentioned parallel formal disciplines which, in accord with their essence, are built up upon the corresponding theory of forms as their lower level. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Included in the syntheticalforms</span><span class="font17">——which, as forms of positings or posita pertaining to the categories of posita in question, obviously presuppose much but leave it undetermined in its particularity — </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> priori conditions of possible validity which are expressed in the set of eidetic laws which govern the disciplines in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Specifically, the a priori conditions of the possibility of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doxic certainty of reason</span><span class="font17"> — stated noematically, of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">possible truth</span><span class="font17"> — are included in the pure forms of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">predicative</span><span class="font17"> (analytic) syntheses. The Objective exhibition &lt;of the doxic certainty of reason&gt; is produced by formal logic in the narrowest sense: the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal apophantics</span><span class="font17"> (the formal logic of &quot;judgments&quot;) which_thus has its foundation in the theory of forms of these <sup>&lt;^</sup>judgmel^ts.^^</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Something similar holds for the synthesizings and their noematic correlates belonging to the emotional and conative acts, thus for their kinds of synthetical &quot;posita,&quot; the systematic theory of forms of which must serve again as the substratum for the structure of the formal theory of validity. Actually implicit precisely in the pure synthetical </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">forms</span><span class="font17"> of these spheres (as, e.g., in the connections of ends and means)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;306&gt; are </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">conditions of the possibility of axiological and practical<sup>(&lt;</sup> truths</span><span class="font17"> In that case, by virtue of &quot;Objectivating” which, e.g. is also effected in emotional acts, all axiological and practical </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">rationality</span><span class="font17"> as we understand it is converted into doxic rationality and, noematically, into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">truths</span><span class="font17"> objectively into </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actuality:</span><span class="font17"> we speak of true or actual goals, means, preferences, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">U nderstandably, unique and highly important phenomenological investigations are related to all these complexes. Already the kind of characterization of the formal disciplines just given is phenomenological and presupposes a great deal from our analyses. In </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure logic </span><span class="font17">dealt with &quot;dogmatically J the researcher abstractively seizes upon the apophantic forms (&quot;any positum whatever/<sup>5</sup> or &quot;judgment” </span><span class="font7">一 </span><span class="font17">categorial, hypothetical, conjunctive, disjunctive judgment, etc.) and fixes axioms of formal truth for them. He knows nothing of analytical synthesis, of noetic-noematic relations of essences, of the inclusion of the essence he has singled out, seized upon and conceptually fixed, in the eidetic complex of pure consciousness; he carries out his research in isolation of what can only be understood fully in this full eidetic context. Only by regress to the sources of intuition in transcendentally purified consciousness does phenomenology make clear to us what is properly implied when, at one time, we speak of formal conditions of the truth and, at other times, of the forms of cognition. Universally, it clarifies for us </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essences and relations among essences</span><span class="font17"> which belong to the concepts of cognition, evidence, truth, being (object, predicatively formed affair-complex, etc.); it teaches us to understand the structure of judgings and judgments, the manner in which the structure of the noema is epistemically determinative, how in that connection the &quot;posita” play their special role and, again, the differing possibility of its epistemic &quot;fullness?<sup>5</sup> It shows which manners of fulfillment are essential conditions for the rational characteristic of evidence, which kinds of evidence are in question in any given case; and so forth. It especially allows us to understand that involved in the case of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">priori truths of logic</span><span class="font17"> are eidetic connections between the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">possibility of intuitive fulfillment</span><span class="font17"> of the positum (whereby the corresponding predicatively formed affair-complex enters into synthetical intuition) and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pure synthetical form</span><span class="font17"> of the positum (of the logically pure form), and that, at the same time, each possibility is the condition for possible validity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Seen more precisely, phenomenology also shows that two things &lt;307&gt; are to be distinguished here which correspond to the correlation of</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">noesis and noema. In formal apophantics (e.g., in the syllogistic) we speak ofjudgments, as noematic posita, and their &quot;fbrmal truth.&quot; Throughout, the focus is noematic. On the other hand, in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal apophantic noetics</span><span class="font17"> the focus is noetic; we speak of rationality, correctness of judging; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">norms</span><span class="font17"> of this correctness are enounced and, more particularly, in relation to the forms of posita. For example, one cannot maintain a contradiction as true; whoever judges according to the forms of the premises of valid modes of inference, &quot;must&quot; draw the consequences pertaining to the corresponding forms. In the phenomenological context these parallels are understood at once. The processes which involve thejudgings, the noesis, as well as those corresponding to them in the noema, in the apophansis, are investigated precisely in their necessary mutual relation and in the full weave of consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The same holds, naturally, for the remaining formal disciplines with respect to the parallelism of noetic and noematic regularities.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§148 . Problems of the Theory of Reason Pertaining to Formal Ontology.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">From those disciplines we are led to turn to the corresponding </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ontologies.</span><span class="font17"> The context is already given phenomenologically by the universally possible turning of one's regard which can be effected within each act whereby the constituents, which one has as objects of one's regard, are reciprocally combined with one another by various eidetic laws. The primary attitude is focused on something objective</span><span class="font11">：</span><span class="font17"> the noematic reflection leads to the noematic constituents, the noetic reflection to noetic compositions. From these constituents the disciplines of interest to us here abstractively single out and seize upon pure forms and, more particularly, the formal apophantics seizes upon noematic forms, the parallel noetics, noetic forms. Just as those forms are connected with one another, so both are essentially connected with ontic forms, ontic forms which can be seized upon by turning the regard back to ontic constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Each formal-logical law is to be equivalently converted into a formal ontological law. Instead ofjudgments, predicatively formed affair-complexes will now be judged about; instead of judgmental members (e.g., nominal significations), objects will bejudged about; instead of predicational significations, characteristic marks will be judged about; and so forth. We no longer even speak of truth, of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">validity ofjudicial posita, but rather of the composition pertaining to a predicatively formed affair-complex, of the being of objects, and the like.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;308&gt; Obviously the phenomenological content of this turn is also to be clarified by regress to the content of the determining concepts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Moreover, formal ontology extends very far beyond the spheres of such simple conversions pertaining to formal apophantic truths. Great disciplines accrue to it by that &quot;nominalization&quot; of which we spoke before.<sup>2</sup> In plural judging, the plural appears as plural positing.<sup>3</sup> By the nominalizing turn the object becomes the set, and accordingly the fundamental concept of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">theory of sets arises.</span><span class="font17"> In this theory, sets are judged </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">about</span><span class="font17"> as objects which have their relevant kinds of properties, relations, etc. The same is true for the concepts of relation, number, etc., as fundamental concepts of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mathematical disciplines.</span><span class="font17"> Again, in the case of the theory of simple forms of posita we have to say that it is not the task of phenomenology to develop these disciplines, thus to cultivate mathematics, syllogistics, etc. Only the axioms and their conceptual composition interest phenomenology as names for phenomenological analyses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What has been said is transferred to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the formal axiology and the theory of practice,</span><span class="font17"> as well as to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal ontologies of values</span><span class="font17"> (in a very extended sense &lt;of the term value&gt;), of goods, which are coordinate to formal axiology and theory of practice as theoretical desiderata — in short, to the whole ontic spheres which are correlates of emotional and conative consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One will note that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in these considerations the concept of<sup>&lt;c</sup>formal ontology^ has been extended.</span><span class="font17"> The concrete values, the practical objectivities, are subsumed under the formal name, ''objects/<sup>5</sup> &quot;anything whatever?<sup>5 </sup>From the standpoint of universal analytic ontology, they are therefore materially determined objects; the relevant <sup>&lt;&lt;</sup>fbrmal<sup>,5</sup> ontologies of concrete values and practical objectivities are therefore material disciplines. On the other hand, the analogies, grounded in the parallelism of posited genera (belief or modalities of belief concrete</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">values, willing) and the syntheses and syntactical formations attached to them, have their power and indeed such an efficacious one that Kant directly designated<sup>4</sup> as &quot;analytic&quot; the relation of willing of the end to willing of the means, and thereby certainly confuses &lt;309&gt; analogy with identity. The analytic proper, which belongs to the predicative synthesis of doxa, need not be confused with its formal analogon which is related to the syntheses of emotional and conative positings. Profound and important problems pertaining to the phenomenology of reason are attached to the radical clarification of these analogies and parallels.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">§/49. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Problems of the Theory of Reason Pertaining to Regional Ontologies. The Problem of Phenomenological Constitution.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">After having discussed the problems of the theory of reason set for us by the formal disciplines, we must make the transition to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">material </span><span class="font17">and, first of all, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">regional, ontologies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Each objective region is constituted in the manner peculiar to consciousness. An object determined by the regional genus has, as object, in so far as it is actual, its a priori predesignated modes of being perceivable, somehow objectivatable clearly or obscurely, conceivable, demonstrable. We thus return again, in view of what founds rationality, to senses, posita or propositions, epistemic essences</span><span class="font11">；</span><span class="font17"> but now not to the simple forms: instead, since we have our eye on the material universality of regional and categorial essences, we return to those posita the determinational content of which is taken in its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">regional</span><span class="font17"> determinateness. Each region here furnishes the clues to an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intrinsically self-contained group of investigations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let us take, for example, the region, Material Thing, as clue. If we correctly understand what this guide means, then at the same time we seize upon, accordingly, a universal problem which is determinative for a great and relatively self-contained phenomenological discipline: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the problem of the universal &quot;constitution&quot; in transcendental consciousness of objectivities pertaining to the region, Physical Thing.</span><span class="font17"> More briefly expressed: &quot;the phenomenological constitution of any physical thing whatever.<sup>M</sup> Along with this we also become acquainted</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">with the methods of investigation coordinate with this guiding problem. Precisely the same holds, then, for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">each</span><span class="font17"> region and for each discipline related to its phenomenological constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What is involved is the following: the idea of the physical thing, to remain with this region, if we speak of it now, is represented in the manner peculiar to consciousness by the conceptual thought, <sup>4&lt;</sup>phys-ical thing,&quot; with a certain noematic composition. To every noema </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">310</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">there essentially corresponds an ideally closed group of possible noemata which have their unity by being capable of a synthetical unification by coincidence. If the noema, as here, is a harmonious one, then intuitive and especially originarily presentive noemata are found in the group —• noemata in which all other sorts of noemata of the group are fulfilled in the identifying coincidence, drawing from them the confirmation, the fullness of the power of reason in the case of positionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We thus proceed from the verbal, perhaps quite obscure, objectivation of the physical thing as we directly have it. In freedom we generate intuitive objectivations of the same any- &quot;physical thing&quot;-whatever and we make the vague sense of the word clear to us. Since a ''universal objectivation&quot; is involved, we must proceed by way of example. Let us generate optional intuitions in phantasy of physical things, such as free intuitions of winged horses, white ravens, golden mountains, and the like; they would, in any case, be physical things, and objectivations of them therefore serve as examples just as well as objectivations of the physical things given to actual experience. Effecting ideation on that basis, in intuitive clarity we seize upon the essence, ''physical thing,&quot; as the subject of universally delimited noematic determinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It must now be noticed (recalling what has already been established earlier<sup>5</sup>) that, in this connection, the essence, &quot;physical thing,&quot; is, to be sure, originarily given, but that this givenness of essential necessity can never be an adequate one. We can make the noema or the physical thing-sense adequately given to us; but the multiple physical thing-senses, even taken in their fullness, do not contain the regional essence, ''physical thing,&quot; as an originarily-intuitive composition immanent in them, no more than the multiple senses related to one and the same physical thing contain the individual essence of the physical thing. In other words, regardless of</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">whether it is a question of the essence of a physical thing-individuum or of the regional essence, <sup>4&lt;</sup>any physical thing whatever,<sup>5,</sup> there is no case in which a single intuition of a physical thing or a finite, closed continuity or collection of intuitions of physical things would be sufficient to acquire in an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">adequate</span><span class="font17"> manner the desired essence in the whole fullness of its essential determinatenesses. But that suffices for an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">inadequate</span><span class="font17"> seeing of essences; in contrast to an empty seizing upon an essence such as one to be established on the exempflicative substratum of an obscure objectivation, it always has the great advantage of having the essence originarily given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This is true for all levels of eidetic universality, from the essence ofan &lt;311 &gt;&nbsp;individual all the way up to the region, Physical Thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now, however, it is a generical eidetic insight that each </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">imperfect givenness^</span><span class="font17"> (each inadequately presentive noema) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">includes in itself </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> rule for the ideal possibility of its being perfected.</span><span class="font17"> It belongs to the essence of the appearance of the centaur which I now have — a merely &quot;one-sided” appearance presentive of the essence of the centaur — that I can trace out the different sides of the physical thing, that what remains undetermined and open in the first place can be made determinate and intuitive in free phantasy. In the continuation of this always more perfect intuitional, more precisely determining process of phantasy, we are in a wide measure </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">free;</span><span class="font17"> indeed, at random we can intuitionally ascribe to the phantasied centaur more precisely determining properties and changes in properties; but we are not </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">completely free</span><span class="font17"> provided we ought to progress in the sense of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">harmonious</span><span class="font17"> course of intuition in which the subject to be determined is identically the same and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font17"> always remain harmoniously determinable. We are, e.g., bound by a law-conforming </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">space</span><span class="font17"> as a frame prescribed for us by the idea of any possibl </span><span class="font7">舛 </span><span class="font17">hysical thing whatever. However arbitrarily we may deform wha/is phantasied, spatial forms are always again converted into spatial forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But what does it mean phenomenologically to speak of rule or law? What is implied by the fact that the inadequately given </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">region,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>b</sup>Insertion in Copy D to the beginning</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> qf </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">this paragraph (published by Schuhmann as Appendix 75, ca. </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">/9/5): It should be noted that by <sup>&lt;l</sup>impcrfect givenness<sup>,,</sup> wc understand precisely a givenncss which, as a givenness, can include no discordancies, e.g., the inadequate appearance of an object. Discordancies can enter in through syntheses, eg, when further objcctivations and, more particularly, those which, with respect to the X, coincide with the appearance, are combined with the appearance of the object. How wc understand the word ''apprehension&quot; in all contexts where we impute an apprehension to an appearance, is a question there not of an objectivation proper, but instead of a characteristic, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^physical thing J prescribes rules for the course &quot;&nbsp;intuitions</span><span class="font17"> — and that signifies, manifestly, as well for possible perceptions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The answer is: There belong to the essence ofsuch a physical thing-noema, and with absolute evidence, ideal possibilities </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">oVlimitlessness in the progression!&quot;<sup>1</sup> &quot;&nbsp;harmonious intuitions</span><span class="font17"> and, more particularly, according to typically determined predesignated directions (therefore also parallel limitlessnesses in the continuous sequential concatenations of the corresponding noeses). Let us recall here the earlier expositions concerning the acquisition by intellectual seeing of the universal &quot;idea,” Any Physical Thing Whatever, which remains valid for each lower level of universality down to the lowest concretion of the individually determined physical thing. Its transcendence is expressed in each limitlessness in the progression of intuitions of it. Always and again the intuitions are to be converted &lt;312&gt; into intuitional continua and the pregiven continua are to be amplified. No perception of the physical thing is definitively closed; there is always room for new perceptions, for determining more precisely the indeterminatenesses, for fulfilling the unfulfilled. With every progression the dcterminational content of the physical thing-noema, which continually belongs to the same physical thing-X, is enriched. It is an eidetic insight that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">each</span><span class="font17"> perception and multiplicity of perceptions is capable of being amplified; the process is thus an endless one; accordingly, no intuitive seizing upon the physical thing-essence can be so complete that a further perception cannot noematically contribute something new to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the other hand, we still seize upon the &quot;idea,&quot; Physical Thing, with evidence and adequately. In the consciousness of the limitlessness of the progression of harmonious intuitions, we seize upon &lt;the &quot;idea&quot;</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">free</span><span class="font17"> process of running-through. We first of all seize upon the unfulfilled idea of the physical thing and this individual physical thing as something which is given &quot;so far,<sup>?,</sup> precisely as far as the harmonious intuition &quot;reaches,” but thereby remains determinable </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;'in infinitum.&quot;</span><span class="font17"> The &quot;etc.” is an evident and absolutely indispensable moment in the physical thing-noema.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On the basis of the consciousness of this limitlessness as an example, we seize upon, furthermore, the &quot;idea&quot; of determined directions ofinfinity and, more particularly, for each ofthe directions</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">of the intuitional course which we run through.

Explained more precisely</span><span class="font11">：</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In its ideal essence, the physical thing is given as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">res temporalis,</span><span class="font17"> in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span><span class="font7"> '力了血''</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of time.</span><span class="font17"> The intuitive &quot;ideation&quot; (which quite particularly deserves its name as the seeing of the &quot;idea&quot;) acquaints us with the physical thing as necessarily enduring, as of necessity endlessly extendable in view of its duration. In </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>cc</sup>pure intuition<sup>,,</sup></span><span class="font17"> (for this ideation is the phenomenologically clarified concept of Kanfs pure intuition) we seize upon the &quot;idea&quot; of temporality and all the essential moments included in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The physical thing is, furthermore, according to its idea, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">res extensa;</span><span class="font17"> it is capable, e.g., with respect to space, ofinfinitely multiple changes in form and, in the case where the shape and alterations in &lt;313&gt; shape are retained as identical, of infinitely multiple alterations of place; it is &quot;moveable&quot; in infinitum. We seize upon the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;idea&quot; of space </span><span class="font17">and the ideas included in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Finally, the physical thing is a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">res materialis;</span><span class="font17"> it is a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">substantial</span><span class="font17"> unity and as such a unity it is a unity of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">causalities</span><span class="font17"> and, with respect to possibility, of infinitely complex causalities. With these specifically real properties we also encounter ideas. Thus </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> components of the idea of the physical thing are themselves ideas; each one </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">implies</span><span class="font17"> the &quot;and so fbrth^^ of &quot;infinite'' possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What we have carrkd^t here is not &quot;theory,'' &quot;metaphysics.&quot; It is a matter of eidetic ^necessities indefeasibly included in the physical thing-noema and, correlatively, in the consciousness presentive of the physical thing, to be seized upon throughout by intellectual seeing and to be systematically investigated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§150 . Continuation. The Region, Physical Thing<sub>}</sub> As Transcendental Clue.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">After having made understandable to ourselves in the most universal terms the infinities which the intuition of the physical thing as</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">physical thing (with respect to noesis and noema) includes in itself—— or, as we can also say: the idea of the physical thing and the dimensions of infinity which it includes in itself——soon we shall be able to understand too the extent to which the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">region, Physical Thing, </span><span class="font17">can serve </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">as clue</span><span class="font17"> for phenomenological investigations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Intuiting an individual physical thing, its movements, its approaching and receding, its revolvings, its alterations in form and quality, pursuing in intuition its modes of causal relations, we </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">effect </span><span class="font17">continua of intuitings which coincide thus and so, which join together into a unity-consciousness: the regard is accordingly directed to the identical, to the X of the sense (or of the posited or neutralized positum), to the one and the same </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">itself</span><span class="font17"> changing, revolving, etc. The case is the same when we follow after, in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">free</span><span class="font17"> intuition, the infinitely possible modifications with respect to the different fundamental directions in the consciousness oflimitlessness in progression pertaining to this intuitional process. And likewise, again, when we go over to the attitude ofideation and, let us say, make clear the regional idea of the physical thing: thus proceeding in that case like the geometer in the freedom and purity of his geometrical intuition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But with all of this we do not know anything about the processes of &lt;314&gt; intuition itself and the essence and essential infinities which pertain to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;intuition&gt;;</span><span class="font17"> we know nothing about the latter's stuff and noetic moments, nothing about its noematic constituents, about the differentiable and eidetically graspable strata on both sides. What we actually livingly experience (or are conscious of in phantasy modification) we do not </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">see.</span><span class="font17"> Therefore a change in attitude is required; the different hyletic, noetic, noematic &quot;reflections'' are required (collectively quite correctly named &quot;reflections'' since they are deviations of the original &quot;straightfbrward'' direction of the regard to the X). It is these reflections which now open up for us a great field of research, coherent in itself that is to say, a powerful set of problems subsumed under the idea of the region, Physical Thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This, then, raises the question:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">How are we to describe systematically the noeses and noemas belonging to the unity of the intuitively objectwating consciousness of the physical thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Ifwe confine ourselves to the noematic sphere, then the question is: How do the multiple posited intuitions, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^intuitionalposita^</span><span class="font17"> look in which an &quot;actual&quot; physical thing becomes given and, in the manner peculiar to intuition, shows its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actuality</span><span class="font17"> in originaliter </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^experienced?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In order to abstract from the doxic position, how do the mere —</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">noematically understood ——</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">appearances</span><span class="font17"> look, appearances which, in themselves, considered purely eidetically, “make appear&quot; one and the same physical thing, the quite determined physical thing at any time, which belongs to this intuition-multiplicity or appearancemultiplicity as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span><span class="font17"> correlate? Of essential necessity, phenomenology does not remain with vague talk, with obscure universalities; it demands systematically determined clarification, analysis and description which penetrate into eidetic complexes and down to the ultimate particularizations attainable of those complexes: phenomenology demands exhaustive </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The regional idea</span><span class="font17"> of the physical thing, its identical X with its determining sense-content, posited as existing, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">prescribes rules governing the multiplicities of appearances.</span><span class="font17"> That means: there are no multiplicities whatever which accidentally come together, which already follows from the fact that, in themselves, purely essentially, they have a relationship to the physical thing, the determined physical thing. The idea of the region prescribes a quite determined, determinately ordered, strictly closed series of appearances progressing in infinitum taken as an ideal collectivity — a determined, internal organization of their flows which, in conformity with essence and accessible to investigation, cohere with partial ideas universally designated in the regional idea of the physical thing as its components. It is shown, for &lt;315&gt; example — as a concrete portion of this organization — that the unity of a mere res extensa is conceivable without the unity for which the idea of the res materialis is a norm: although no res materialis is conceivable which would not be a res extensa. It becomes apparent (always in eidetic phenomenological intuition) that each physical thing-appearance necessarily includes in itself a stratum which we call the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">physical thing-schema:</span><span class="font17"> it is the spatial shape merely filled with &quot;sensuous&quot; qualities ^x^hout any determinateness of ''substantiality&quot; and &quot;causality&quot; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(scl.</span><span class="font17"> in inverted commas, understood as noematically modified). Already the relevant idea of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mere</span><span class="font17"> res extensa is the name for a wealth of phenomenological problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There are many affairs which we take as simple facts in phenomenological naivete: that to &quot;us human beings&quot; a spatial thing always appears in a certain &quot;orientation J e.g., oriented in the visual field of sight with respect to above and below, left and right, near and far; that we can see a physical thing only at a certain &quot;depth J &quot;distance;&quot; that all the changing distances at which it is to be seen are related to an invisible center of all depth-orientations familiar to us as an</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ideal limit-point which we &quot;localize&quot; in the head ——all these alleged facticities, thus contingencies ofintuition of space, which are alien to the &quot;true,&quot; the &quot;objective&quot; space, prove to be eidetic necessities even in the least significant empirical particularities. It is shown, therefore, that something such as a physical thing in space is only intuitable by means of appearances in which it is and must be given in multiple but determined changing &quot;perspective&quot; modes and, accordingly, in changing &quot;orientations&quot; not just for human beings but also for God — as the ideal representative of absolute cognition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is now necessary not only to legitimate this as a universal thesis but to follow it through in accord with all single formations. The problem of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;origin of the idea of spaced</span><span class="font17"> the profbundest phenomenological sense of which has never been grasped, is reduced to the phenomenological analysis of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essence</span><span class="font17"> of all the noematic (and noetic) phenomena in which space is intuitively presented and is &quot;constituted&quot; as the unity of appearances, of descriptive modes of presentation of something spatial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Accordingly, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">problem of constitution</span><span class="font17"> clearly signifies nothing else but that the regulated series of appearances </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessarily</span><span class="font17"> belonging together in the unity of what appears can become intuitively sur-&lt;316&gt; veyed and seized upon theoretically — in spite of their infinities (unambiguously controllable precisely in the determined &quot;and so fbrth&quot;)——</span><span class="font11">：</span><span class="font17">that, in their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">eidetic</span><span class="font17"> own peculiarity, they are analyzable and describable; and that the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">law-conforming production of perfect correlation between what determinate^ appears as unity and the determinately infinite multiplicities of appearances</span><span class="font17"> can become fully seen intellectually and thus all enigmas can be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This holds likewise for the unity inherent in the res extensa (the res temporalis, too), thus also no less for higher unities, the founded ones, which the expression, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^material</span><span class="font17"> physical thing,&quot; i.e., the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">substantial-causal</span><span class="font17"> physical thing, indicates. All these unities are constituted at the level of experiencing intuition in &quot;multiplicities,'' and everywhere the eidetic concatenations of both sides must be illuminated completely in all their strata with respect to sense and sense-fullness, positional functions, etc. Finally, there must emerge from this perfect intellectual seeing of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">what the idea &quot;&nbsp;the actual physical thing represents in phenomenologically pure consciousness,</span><span class="font17"> how it is the absolutely necessary correlate of a structurally investigated and eidetically described noetic-noematic complex.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">These investigations are essentially determined by the different </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">levels and strata of physical thing-constitution in the framg of originary experiencing consciousness.</span><span class="font17"> Every level, and every stratum in the level, is characterized by the fact that it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">constitutes an own peculiar unity</span><span class="font17"> which, on its side, is a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">necessary middle member</span><span class="font17"> for the full constitution of the physical thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If we take, for example, the level of the perceptual physical thing-constitution, the correlate ofwhich is the thing pertaining to the senses furnished with sensuous qualities, then we refer to a single stream of consciousness, to the possible perceptions of a single perceiving Ego-subject. Here we find many sorts of unity-strata: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sensuous schemata^</span><span class="font17"> the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;sight things&quot;</span><span class="font17"> of a higher and lower order which must be perfectly exhibited in this order and studied with respect to their noetic-noematic constitution both in isolation and in their interconnectedness. At the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">highest</span><span class="font17"> strata pertaining to this level there is the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">substantial-causal physical thing,</span><span class="font17"> already a reality in the specific sense of the term, but always still constitutively restricted to one experiencing &lt;317) subject and his ideal perceptual multiplicities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">next higher level</span><span class="font17"> is then the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">inter subjectively identical physical thing </span><span class="font17">—a constitutive unity of a higher order. Its constitution is related to an open plurality in relation to subjects &quot;understanding one another.&quot; The intersubjective world is the correlate of intersubjective experience, i.e., &lt;experience&gt; mediated by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;empathyy</span><span class="font17"> We are, as a consequence, referred to the multiple unities of things pertaining to the senses which are already individually constituted by the many subjects; in further course we are referred to the corresponding perceptual multiplicities thus belonging to different Ego-subjects and streams of consciousness; above all, however, we are referred to the novel factor of empathy and to the question of how it plays a constitutive role in &quot;Objective'' experience and bestows unity on those separated multiplicities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Moreover, all the investigations must be carried out in the completeness and comprehensiveness required by the essence of the affairs in question. Thus, in conformity with the goals of an introduction, we have, above, fixed our regard on merely a first, a fundamental, system of constituting multiplicities of appearances, that is to say, those in which one and the same physical thing always</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">harmoniously appears. In limitless progressions with respect to all systematic lines, perceptions become purely coincident, the positings continually undergo confirmation. There is only more precise determination here, never determination otherwise. None of the physical thing-determinations which have been posited by the previous flow of experience (within this inherently-ideally closed system) undergo &quot;cancellation&quot; and &quot;substitution&quot; by other determinations pertaining to the same category of determination which is formally predesignated by the regional essence. There are no disturbances of the harmony and no processes which counterbalance the disturbances, not to mention that &quot;exploding&quot; of the harmony by which the posited physical thing is entirely cancelled. But now these counter cases are no less to be accounted for phenomenologically since they too play or can play their role in the complex of possible constitution of experiential actuality. The pathway of factual as well as ideally possible cognition leads through errors, even at the lowest cognitive level, the level of intuitively seizing upon actuality. Thus the perceptual flows, in which partial ruptures of harmony occur and in which the harmony is to be preserved only by means of &quot;cor</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> rections,'' are to be systematically characterized with respect to the </span><span class="font7">〈</span><span class="font17">318</span><span class="font7">〉</span><span class="font17">noetic and noematic essential constituents: apprehensional alterations, own specific positional processes, the transvaluation and devaluation of what was apprehended before, e.g., as &quot;semblance,&quot; &quot;illusion,&quot; transition to a &quot;conflict'' unresolved here and there; and so forth. Over against the continuous synthesis of harmony, the syntheses of conflict, of misinterpretations and determination otherwise, and whatever else they may be called, must be given their due: for a phenomenology of &quot;true actuality&quot; the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenology of nullifying illusion^</span><span class="font17"> is also quite indispensable.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§152 . Extension of the Problem of Transcendental Constitution to Other Regions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">We see at once that what was said here by way of example for the constitution of the material </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">physical thing</span><span class="font17"> — and, more particularly, what was said with respect to the constitution in the system of multiplicities of experience </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">prior</span><span class="font17"> to all &quot;thinking&quot;——must be extended to all </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">regions of objects</span><span class="font17"> with respect to problems and with respect to methods. For &quot;sensuous perceptions<sup>55</sup> there now enter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">naturally, the kinds of originarily presentive acts essentially coordinate to the regions in question — acts which must be exhibited and investigated beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Very difficult problems are attached to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">interwovenness of different regions.</span><span class="font17"> They condition combinations in the constituting fashionings of consciousness. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">physical thing</span><span class="font17"> is nothing isolated in contrast to the experiencing subject, as has already been noted in the indications above concerning the intersubjective constitution of the “Objective&quot; physical thing-world. Now, however, this experiencing subject is himself constituted in experience as something real, as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">human being</span><span class="font17"> or as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">brute, just</span><span class="font17"> as the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">intersubjective communities</span><span class="font17"> are constituted as communities of humans and other animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Although essentially founded in psychical realities which, for their part, are founded in physical realities, these communities prove to be novel </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">objectivities of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> higher order.</span><span class="font17"> Universally it is shown that there are many sorts of objectivities which defy all psychologistic and naturalistic misinterpretations. Such are all kinds of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">value-objects</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">practical </span><span class="font17">objects, all concrete cultural formations which determine our actual life as hard realities, such as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the state, the law, custom, the churchy</span><span class="font17"> and so forth. Objectnesses must be described with respect to fundamental &lt;319&gt; kinds and in their hierarchies just as they become given, and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">problems of constitution</span><span class="font17"> set and solved for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Quite clearly their constitution also leads back to that of something physical in space and to psychical subjects: they are founded precisely in such realities. As the lowest level, finally, material reality grounds all other realities and, as a consequence, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">phenomenology of material Nature</span><span class="font17"> assuredly acquires </span><span class="font11">〃</span><span class="font17"> </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pre-eminent place.</span><span class="font17"> But seen without prejudice and phenomenologically led back to their sources, the founded unities are Precisely founded and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">novel]</span><span class="font17"> the novel factor, which is constituted with them, can, as eidetic intuition teaches, never become redu&amp;d to the mere sum of other realities. Thus in fact </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">each own specifically peculiar type of such actualities</span><span class="font17"> carries along with it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">its own peculiar constitutive phenomenology</span><span class="font17"> and therefore a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">new concrete theory of reason.</span><span class="font17"> In every case the task is essentially the same: It is necessary to make cognized with respect to all levels and strata the complete system of fashionings of consciousness which constitute the originary givenness of all such Objectivenesses, and consequently to make understandable the consciousness-equivalent of the kind of “actuality” in question. Also everything which can be truthfully said here in order to preclude the many and obvious misunderstandings involved</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">in the correlation of being and consciousness (as, e.g., that all actuality is &quot;resolved into the psychicaF<sup>5</sup>), can only be said on the basis of the eidetic interrelations of the constitutive groups seized upon in the phenomenological attitude and in the light of intuition.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">§153 . The full Extension of the Transcendental Problem. The Articulation of the Investigations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">A discussion of so general a sort which has only been possible up to now cannot evoke an adequate idea of the enormous extent of the investigations recognized and required as possible so far. To that end, at least for the major types of actualities, portions of detailed investigations would be needed; it would, therefore, be necessary to proceed as we did with respect to the set of problems pertaining to the universal structures of consciousness. Meanwhile in the next Book discussion of the controversies which occupy so much of current thought concerning the mutual relationship of the groups of sciences &lt;320&gt; designated by the names of the natural sciences, psychology and the cultural sciences, and especially concerning their relationship to phenomenology, will provide the occasion, at the same time, to draw the problems of constitution into an accessible proximity. But so much should already have been made clear here: that the controversies actually involve serious problems and that provinces of investigations have been opened up concerning </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">everything which</span><span class="font7"> 衣，</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in the genuine sense, essentially necessary to all sciences with a material content.</span><span class="font17"> The &quot;es</span><span class="font11">・</span><span class="font17"> sential and fundamental&quot; is indeed nothing else but what is grouped around the regional ideas according to the basic concepts and basic cognitions, and what finds or must find its systematic unfolding in the corresponding regional ontologies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What has been said is extended from the sphere of material objects to the sphere offbrmal objects and to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ontological disciplines</span><span class="font17"> appropriate to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">latter,</span><span class="font17"> therefore to all principles and any sciences whatever based on principles — provided that we suitably broaden the idea of constitution. The frames of constitutive inquiry are accordingly, of course, broadened such that what has been said can encompass the whole of phenomenology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">That will emerge by itself when we add the following supplementary considerations:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the first place, there are the problems of the constitution of</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">objects related to the multiplicities of possible </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">originarily presentive </span><span class="font17">consciousness. Thus, for example, in the case of physical things, there are the problems related to the totality of possible </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">experiences,</span><span class="font17"> indeed, perceptions of one and the same physical things. Following upon this is the supplementary consideration of the reproductive sorts of positing consciousness and the explorations of their constitutive rational production or, what amounts to the same thing, their production for intuitive cognition simpliciter; the same is the case for consideration of the obscurely objectivating (but simpliciter) consciousness and the problems of reason and actuality related to it. In short, we move, first of all, in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mere sphere qf<sup>c&lt;</sup>objectivationy</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But connected with that are the corresponding investigations which refer to the productions of a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">higher</span><span class="font17"> sphere, the so-called </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^sphere of the understanding&quot; ^ or qf<sup>c&lt;</sup>reason&quot;</span><span class="font17"> in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">narrower</span><span class="font17"> sense of the term, with their explicating, relating and otherwise &quot;logical&quot; (also, then, axiological and practical) syntheses; with their &quot;conceptual&quot; operations, their statements, their new mediating forms of grounding. Objectivities which were given first of all in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">monothetical acts,</span><span class="font17"> let us say, in simple experiences (or conceived as given in the idea), can be made subject to the play of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">synthetical operations</span><span class="font17"> and by virtue of them constitute synthetical objectivities of an always higher level — objectivities which contain a number of positings in the unity of the positing as a whole and which contain a number of materials standing out as members in the unity of their total material. One can collect, <sup>&lt;c</sup>fashioning<sup>M</sup> collectiva (sets) of different hierarchical orders (sets of sets); one can &quot;single out&quot; or &quot;abstract&quot; &quot;parts&quot; from &quot;wholes,&quot; properties, predicates in their subjects; one can &quot;relate&quot; objects to objects, at will &quot;making&quot; this one into the referential term, the other into die object referred to; and so forth. One can effect such syntheses &quot;a</span><span class="font11">(</span><span class="font17">/ually J &quot;properly J i.e., in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">synthetical originarity;</span><span class="font17"> then, in accord with its synthetical form, the synthesized objectivity has the characteristic ofbeing originarily given (e.g., &lt;the characteristio of the actually given collection, subsumption, relation, etc.), and it has the full characteristic of originarity if the positings have it, thus if the positing act-characteristics are originarily motivated as rational. One can also draw upon free phantasies, relate the originarily given and the quasi-given, or else effect the syntheses exclusively in the form of modification, change the object of consciousness into a &quot;supposed&quot; object, &quot;Game'' hypotheses, <sup>&lt;c</sup>draw consequences&quot; from them; or else draw comparisons and distinctions, subject the similar-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;321&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">ities and differences themselves given in them to synthetical operations combined with all the ideations, eidetic positions and suppositions; and thus in infinitum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Moreover, underlying the operations are acts which are partly intuitional, partly non-intuitional, or else quite confused, oflower and higher levels of Objectivation. In the case of obscurity or confusion, one can set out to clarify the synthetically <sup>44</sup>produced formations,<sup>M</sup> to raise the question of their possibility, of their resolution by means of ''synthetical intuition;&quot; or also the question of their &quot;actuality J of their being resolved by means of explicit and originarily presentive synthetical acts, or by way of mediate &quot;inferences” or &quot;proofk&quot; Phenomenologically, all of these types of synthesis, in perfect correlation with the synthetically &quot;constituted'' objectivities in them, are to be submitted to investigation; the different modes of givenness and their signification for &quot;actual being&quot; of such objectivities, or for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">truly </span><span class="font17">being possible, for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">actually</span><span class="font17"> being probable, are to be clarified; and the same is the case for all questions of reason, truth and actuality. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Thus </span><span class="font17">here </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">too</span><span class="font17"> we have </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;problems of constitution.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now, the logical syntheses are, to be sure, grounded in the lowest positings with simple materials (senses), but in a manner such that &lt;322&gt; the system of eidetic laws pertaining to the levels of synthesis, and specifically the laws of reason — in a very broad, determinately delimited &quot;fbrmal'' sphere — are independent of the particular materials of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">members</span><span class="font17"> of the synthesis. Precisely by this means a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">universal</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal logic</span><span class="font17"> indeed becomes possible, &lt;a logio which abstracts from the &quot;material&quot; of logical cognition and thinks it in undetermined, freely variable universality (as ''something or other&quot;) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">As </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">〃</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> consequence, the investigations related to constitution are also distinguished </span><span class="font17">into those which, on the one hand, follow the basic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">formal</span><span class="font17"> concepts and take </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">them</span><span class="font17"> alone as &quot;clues&quot; to problems of reason, or problems of actuality and of truth; on the other hand, those which, as previously sketched, follow the basic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">regional</span><span class="font17"> concepts and, in first place, the concept of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">region itself,</span><span class="font17"> and, to be sure, with the question of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">how </span><span class="font17">something individual in such a region attains to givenness. With the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">regional categories</span><span class="font17"> and the investigations predesignated by them, justice is done to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">particular determination which the synthetical form undergoes by virtue of the regional material;</span><span class="font17"> and justice is done&gt; likewise to the influence which the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">particular restrictions</span><span class="font17"> (such as find expression in the regional axioms) </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">exercise on the regional actuality</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Manifestly what has been explained is transferred to all spheres of</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">acts and objects, therefore </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">also to the objectivities for the constituting of which emotional acts with their specific positings and materials have to be</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">priori responsible,</span><span class="font17"> and in a manner again with respect to form and material particularity, which it is the great, scarcely suspected, let alone adopted, task of the corresponding constitutive phenomenology to clarify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As a consequence, the intimate relationship of the constitutive phenomenologies to the a priori ontologies and, finally, to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> eidetic disciplines, also becomes evident (excepting, here, phenomenology itself). </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The sequence of levels of formal and material theories of essence </span><span class="font17">prescribes in a certain way </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the sequence &quot;&nbsp;levels of the constitutive phenomenologies,</span><span class="font17"> determines their levels of universality and provides them with </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;clues</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">，，</span><span class="font17">in the ontological and materially eidetic fundamental concepts and principles. By way of example, the fundamental concepts of the ontology ofNature, such as time, space, matter, and their immediate derivatives, are indices to strata of constituting consciousness of material thingness, just as the relevant fundamental principles are indices to connections of essences in and between the strata. The &lt;323&gt; phenomenological clarification pertaining to pure logic makes it understandable, then, that and why also all </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mediate</span><span class="font17"> propositions pertaining to the pure theory of time, of geometry, and thus of all ontological disciplines, are indices to sets of eidetic laws of transcendental consciousness and its constituting multiplicities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But it must be explicitly noted that in these interrelations between constitutive phenomenologies and the corresponding formal and material ontologies </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">nothing is implied about the grounding of the former by the latter. Thephenomenologist does notjudge ontologically</span><span class="font17"> when he cognizes an ontological concept or principle as an index to constitutive eidetic complexes, w^n he sees a clue in them for intuitive validations which bear purely within themselves their right and validity. This universal finding will be verified for us much later in more basic expositions which are, in any case, required by virtue of the importance of this situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A comprehensive solution to the problems of constitution which equally takes into consideration the noetic and the noematic strata of consciousness would be manifestly equivalent to a complete phenomenology of reason with respect to all its formal and material fashionings and, at the same time, with respect to its non-normal (negatively rational) as well as its normal (positively rational) &lt;fashionings&gt;. But it must be admitted, furthermore, that so complete</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">a phenomenology of reason would become coincident with phenomenology taken universally, that a systematic working out of all descriptions of consciousness required by the collective name, constitution of objects, must include in itself all descriptions whatever of consciousness.</span></p>
